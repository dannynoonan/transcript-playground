Keel and the other captains, after ascertaining Picard is who they think he is, tells him about a suspected conspiracy within Starfleet citing a strange pattern of orders from Command as evidence. They urge him to be careful. After leaving the planet, the Enterprise comes upon the debris of Keel's ship. Picard asks Data to review the last few months of orders issued by Starfleet. Data reports that there has been an unusual amount of changing of people within the command areas of Starfleet. Picard orders the ship back to Earth where they discover several admirals, including Picard's friend Quinn have been infected by parasitic creatures.  	16.0	enterprise, diverted, mission, special,

Yamato which has been plagued by systems failures. Shortly after the arrival of the Enterprise, the Yamato explodes and a Romulan ship uncloaks. After examining the logs of the Yamato, it becomes clear that the Romulans were not responsible for the destruction of the ship. The captain of the Yamato had apparently found the legendary planet of Iconia and his ship was infected by a computer virus transmitted by a probe from that planet. That virus was apparently the cause of the system failures and the final destruction. Unfortunately, since the Enterprise downloaded the logs from the Yamato's computers, it too has the same virus. Picard must travel to Iconia in the hopes of finding a cure to the virus.  	1.0	enterprise, rushes, neutral, zone, aid, u, yamato, plagued, systems, failures, shortly, arrival, enterprise, yamato,

The Enterprise is sent to fix their reactor but, unfortunately, does not arrive in time to prevent the reactor from exploding and killing most of the scientists. As the Enterprise team begins to tend to the injured and replace the reactor, two of the natives discover the existence of the Federation. Startled, one of them falls and is injured. Dr. Crusher takes him to the Enterprise where he accidentally sees Picard and hears him order the search for a missing scientist continued. Picard also orders Dr. Crusher to erase the short-term memory of the native to preserve the Prime Directive. After he is recovered, Liko is returned to his people where he tells them of his journey and of `the Picard"", a god from their old legends. The natives find the missing scientist and hold him captive in order to force ""The Picard"" to make an appearance. Riker and Troi are beamed down to recover the scientist, but Troi is captured while Riker makes his escape with him. Picard now must decide between Troi's life and maintaining the Prime Directive.

The away team finds the remains of a Romulan ship and one Romulan, barely alive. The away team beams aboard the Enterprise with the Romulan, accidentally stranding Geordi on the planet where he, moments before beam-out time, stumbled into a pit. The crew of the Enterprise struggles to keep the Romulan alive and to locate Geordi on the surface. Meanwhile, on the surface, as Geordi moves closer to the beacon the Enterprise left to guide him, he is taken prisoner by a second Romulan, Bokra. Geordi attempts to convince Bokra that they must work together to stay alive and be rescued while a Romulan Warbird closes in on the Enterprise determined to retrieve their lost comrades from the grip

In this new reality, the Enterprise is at war with the Klingons, a war that they cannot win. Also, Tasha Yar is still alive and serving as Tactical Officer aboard the Enterprise-D. The Enterprise-C is critically damaged and was apparently involved in a fight with Romulans while in defense of a Klingon base. The crews eventually realize that, had the Enterprise-C been successful, the current war with the Klingons might never have happened. Clearly, the Enterprise-C must return even though it is likely to never survive the battle. When the Captain of the Enterprise-C is killed during a Klingon attack, Lt. Castillo asks to take the ship back through the warp himself. Meanwhile, Guinan, whose peculiar senses have told her that things are not as they should be, tells Tasha that in the true timeline, Tasha died an empty death. This convinces Tasha that she should return with the Enterprise-C as their tactical officer so that her death can have some meaning, and so she can be with Castillo with whom she has fallen in love.

They discover that the entire town has been removed and only a crater remains. Fearing that this might be the first step in the invasion by the Borg, the Enterprise takes on board Lt. Commander Shelby who has become the Federation's tactical expert on the Borg. She makes it plain to many that she is highly interested in replacing Riker, who has, again, been offered his own command. Admiral Hanson attempts to convince Picard that Riker should take the new command for the good of his career. After investigating the evidence, they come to the conclusion that it was the Borg that destroyed the colony. Now, the Federation has to develop weapons and defenses against the cyborg aliens. While Shelby and the Enterprise crew struggle with the problem, they learn that a Federation ship sent out a distress call describing an encounter with the Borg. The Enterprise, being the nearest ship, travels to the scene and meet the Borg. The Borg hail Picard specifically and demand that Picard beam aboard their ship immediately, threatening the destruction of the Enterprise if he refuses. Picard, naturally, refuses. After a brief, but losing battle with the Borg, the Enterprise, to escape, enters a nebula with the Borg ship in pursuit. Once in the nebula, they drop to impulse and begin repairs to the ship. They also analyze the recent battle and discover that the Borg are vulnerable to phasers in one particular frequency band. The Borg ship starts mining the nebula and forces the Enterprise out. Once out of the nebula, several Borg beam over to the Enterprise and grab Picard. The Borg then head for Earth. The Enterprise crew must devise a plan to cripple the Borg ship and retrieve Picard. This episode is the finale of the third season and is a cliffhanger episode to be continued in the fourth season.  	2.0	one, outermost, colonies, federation, recently, lost, enterprise, sent,

Meanwhile, the Enterprise comes upon an unusual alien being that lives in space. The alien being, threatened by the presence of the ship attacks and Captain Picard defends the ship with minimal phaser power.

The Admiral, well known for resolving difficult disputes and brilliantly leading investigations arrives on the Enterprise with her entourage and proceeds to investigate the alleged treason. In the course of her investigations she turns up the fact that a crewman, Simon Tarsis, lied on his Acadamey application form. He originally claimed he was a Human/Vulcan hybrid but is actually a Human/Romulan mix. Satie attempts to prove that Tarsis is the person mainly responsible for leaking secrets to the Romulans on a regular basis. Picard objects to her methods and deductions, she accuses Picard of being involved in the conspiracy and threatens to ruin his career in Starfleet.  	1.0	mysterious, explosion, klingon, exchange,

Meanwhile, the Enterprise is on its way to Krios with Ambassador Kell to investigate claims made by the Klingon governor that the Federation has been supplying weapons to rebels on the planet. The Enterprise determines that the weapons being supplied to the rebels, while appearing to be Federation issue are, in fact, manufactured by the Romulans.  While at Krios, La Forge returns to the Enterprise completely unaware that he has been with the Romulans and believing to have spent the time at Risa as planned. He assists Picard in investigating the source of the weapons supplied to the rebels and assists Data in investigating the mysterious E-band signals that the Enterprise has detected. La Forge, under the influence of the Romulans, beams a supply of weapons to the rebels that is intercepted by the governor, causing Vagh to accuse Picard of complicity in the rebellion. When Governor Vagh boards the Enterprise to watch the investigation into the incident, he is nearly assassinated by La Forge, again completely under the influence of the Romulan's conditioning.  During the scenes on the Romulan cruiser when La Forge is being conditioned, a Romulan commander appears in the background hidden in shadows. There has been a lot of speculation as to the identity of the Commander however, the voice of the actress sounds a great deal like Denise Crosby who had left the show.  	2.0	en, route, conference,

Picard, as the chosen arbiter of succession must continue to fulfill his duty to see that Gowron becomes the emperor and that ties with the Federation continue. Meanwhile, Worf speaks to Gowron requesting that Worf's family honor be restored since it was Duras' family who betrayed the Kitomer outpost to the Klingons. Gowron refuses because of the influence that Duras' family still has with the council.  Picard beams down to the planet to perform his final act as arbiter. However, before he can properly install Gowron as the new emperor, Duras' sisters Lursa and B'Etor produce Toral, a bastard child of Gowron, who claims the right to succession. The ceremony is halted until Picard may decide if the child has a legitimate claim.  Worf, seeing the growing problems within the Klingon empire and the possibility of a civil war if Gowron becomes emperor, talks with his brother Kurn who is allied against Gowron. Worf convinces Kurn to lend his support to Gowron's forces so that the support may be used as a bargaining edge to regain the family honor.  Picard decides that Toral is not eligible to become emperor and bestows that title on Gowron. This causes the council to split with some following Gowron and some following Toral who is not only backed by the council and those loyal to the family of Duras but by Romulans led by a mysterious commander.  The Klingon empire is now at war. Worf, his family honor restored, resigns his commission as a Starfleet Officer to aide Gowron and learn what it means to be a Klingon. Meanwhile, the Romulans and the family of Duras make plans that will drag the Federation into the war and to lure Picard to his death.  This cliffhanger episode is the finale of the fourth season and will be concluded in the first episode of the new season. The actor portraying the mysterious Romulan commander is never given any credit in this episode or in THE MIND'S EYE where she first appeared however, it is clearly Denise Crosby. Hopefully, in the conclusion next season, we will discover the true identity of the commander, what her motives are and what caused her hatred for Picard.  	1.0	continuing, events, portrayed, reunion,

The war between Duras' family and Gowron's heats up and Duras appears to be winning. They have had the help of the Romulans commanded by Sela. The Federation wishes to stay out of the fight since it is an internal civil war but Picard convinces the Fleet Admiral that the Romulans may be involved and therefore the Federation should be as well. Picard sets up a blockade to prevent Romulan ships from sending supplies to Duras' forces and eventually, Duras' forces are defeated by Gowrons.  Sela, in one of the strangest (but predictable) twists on the show, claims to be Tasha Yar's daughter. Since Tasha died childless in ""Skin of Evil"", it seems impossible for her to have a grown up daughter much less one in a position of command in the Romulan Empire. For the answer, one needs to look at the events in ""Yesterday's Enterprise"". In that episode, the Enterprise D encountered Enterprise C in an alternate history where Tasha was still alive on the D. At the end of the episode, she returns to the past on the Enterprise C. When the Enterprise D returns to its correct history line, all memories of the encounter vanish and Tasha's existence on the C was forgotten. However, Tasha was captured by the Romulans when she returned to the past on the Enterprise C and eventually married a Romulan General and had a child by him. Tasha was eventually executed for trying to escape the Empire and Sela, Tasha's daughter, now has a hatred for Picard since he sent Tasha back on the Enterprise C. If the writers of the show develop this further, things could get very interesting - I hope they do.

The Bajorans lost their homeworld to the Cardassians and the terrorist attacks, led by Orta, until now had been confined to Cardassian locales. Solarian 4, a Federation outpost in a nearby star system was attacked by a ship claiming to be a Bajoran ship shortly after the Federation and the Cardassians signed a treaty. Admiral Kennely asks Picard to locate the terrorist's base and to bring their leader to the Cardassian system so that peace between the two people's may be arranged.  Admiral Kennely orders Picard to take onboard ship an ensign with a less than honorable past. Ensign Ro had been involved in an incident where she was responsible for the death of a landing party, courtmartialed and imprisoned in the stockade. Admiral Kennelly had her released because she is Bajoran and might be of help on the mission. But Ensign Ro has her own orders and may be part of a Federation conspiracy.  	3.0	terrorist, attack, federation, outpost, prompts, admiral, kennelly, send, enterprise, aid, cardassians, stopping,

Riker and Data help the colonists survive the attack by leading them into caves with a chemistry that the entity apparently can't penetrate. This is the first time that there have been survivors of an attack and Dr. Marr is dispatched to the area to study the planet and interview the survivors. Dr. Marr has made it her life's work to study the entity ever since her son was killed by the entity on Omicron Theta III.  The Enterprise, with Dr. Marr on board pursues the crytalline entity in the hopes of being able to communicate with it and find a way to prevent further destruction. Dr. Marr seems obsessed with not only destroying the entity but also with Data, who apparently has the memories and journal entries of her son in his memory banks.  	1.0	crystalline, entity,

Most of the senior officers are trapped in different places on the ship leaving Troi in command on the bridge. Picard is trapped in a turbolift with three children - winners of a science program. Riker, Data, Worf and Keiko are trapped in ten-forward and Geordi and Dr. Crusher are trapped in a cargo hold.  As the crew begin to recover, they realize that they are trapped in different areas of the ship and without any communication with other crew members. Each trapped group has its own major crises to overcome: Geordi and Dr. Crusher discover a plasma fire in the hold which is giving off radiation and the cargo in that hold explodes if it receives too much radiation; Picard and the children need to leave the turbolift before it begins to fall; Data and Riker try to get to the engineering section; Keiko goes into labor in ten-forward and Worf has to act as a mid-wife with no practical experience; the bridge crew consisting of Chief O'Brien, Ensign Ro, Ensign Mandel and Troi attempt to re-establish power, computer operation and a critical anti-matter containment field in the engines that can cause the ship to explode if not stabilized.  	53.0	enterprise, encounters, cosmic, filament, disrupts, major, systems, ship, senior, officers,

Picard sees a video picture of the Vulcan, Spock, and his Romulan contact. Picard travels to Vulcan to visit Sarek to find out why Spock went to Romulan and what he hopes to accomplish there. Despite Sarek's illness, Picard is able to see him and discovers that Spock has been in touch with a Romulan senator, Pardek. Sarek asks Picard to convey his love to Spock.  Meanwhile, Geordi and Riker inspect several metal fragments recovered from a Ferengi ship. The fragments are remains of a Vulcan Deflector system and the Federation wants to find out how the Ferengi got hold of them. The Vulcans claim to know nothing about the materials and Riker and Geordi conclude that the equipment was stolen.  When Picard returns to the Enterprise, he summons the help of the Klingons to get a cloaked ship for use to travel undetected to Romulus. After several days of unsuccessfully reaching Gowron, Picard finally gets through and convinces Gowron to provide a vessel. Meanwhile, intelligence reports confirm Spock's meeting with Pardek whom Data identifies as an advocate for peace and reunification of the Vulcans and Romulans.  While Riker and Geordi work together to discover how the Vulcan deflector unit ended up in the hands of the Ferengi, Data and Picard disguise themselves as Romulans and travel to Romulus on the Klingon ship. Once they arrive, they transport down and stop at a cafe near Pardek's office. When they spot Pardek and attempt to approach him, they are captured by Romulan guards. Later, however, they discover that Pardek had them arrested for their own protection. As Picard briefs the senator on their meeting, Spock suddenly appears before him.  This episode is the first episode of a two-part story which links the events in the series to the events in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country which opened at theaters about three weeks after this two-part episode first aired. Spock, Pardek and Sarek were key figures in the Khitomer Conference which is one of the events depicted in the movie.  	1.0	admiral, shanti, advises, captain, picard, vulcan, ambassador, gone,

Picard and Spock talk and Spock is initially uncooperative with Picard but soon accepts that Picard is representing the Federation. Picard informs Spock that his father, Sarek, has died and conveys his love to Spock. This helps Spock accept Picard as an ally and tells him that his mission to Romulus involves a plan to reunify its people with the Vulcans. Picard naturally does not trust the Romulans and Spock does not seem to fully trust either the Romulans or Picard. Picard sends Data back to the Klingon ship to attempt and access the Romulans' computer network.  Meanwhile on the Enterprise, Riker continues to investigate the theft of the deflector unit. He contacts Amarie, the ex-wife of a smuggler who was killed when the Enterprise destroyed an unmarked enemy ship that tried to interfere with the investigation.  Back on Romulus, Senator Pardek brings Picard and Spock to meet with Neral, the Romulan Proconsul who claims to support reunification. However, unknown to Spock and Picard, Neral is in league with Selas who appears in Neral's office after the Federation officers leave. Picard is very skeptical that Neral offered his support so readily without the support of the Romulan traditionalists among the council. Spock too is skeptical but is convinced that logic dictates that it is in the Federation's best interest to proceed whether the Romulans have an ulterior motive or not.  Amarie meanwhile puts Riker in touch with a Ferengi trader who reveals that the Romulans are involved in the theft of Vulcan ships. Riker contacts Picard and informs him of what he has learned. The two agree to rendezvous and Riker heads towards Romulan territory. Data, with Spock's help accesses the Romulan computer network and discovers that Neral and Pardek are out to double-cross them. Picard and Data transport back to Romulus to inform Spock and all are taken prisoner by Sela.  Sela informs them that they plan to use the stolen ships to conquer Vulcan. She plans to force Spock to deliver a speech announcing the approaching ships as a peace envoy but, in fact, they will be manned by soldiers with orders to seize control of the Vulcan government. When Spock refuses to cooperate, Sela shows them a holographic image of Spock, Picard and Data which she plans to use instead to complete her plan. When Sela leaves the room, Data and Spock set to work on the computer system to try and find an escape route. They manage to send an emergency signal to the Enterprise, which already suspects some sort of trick since they have been unable to reach Picard. Picard tells them of Sela's plan and the Enterprise destroys the ships.  Sela returns to her office planning to kill Spock and Picard but instead is tricked by holographic images giving the Federation officers the opportunity to subdue her and escape. Picard and Data return to the Enterprise while Spock decides to remain on Romulus in the hope of truly establishing peace with the Romulans.  	1.0	episode, second, part, story, began, unification,

While in the sector, Worf's mother visits the ship with Worf's son, Alexander who has been having difficulties living on Earth.  Alexander stays on the Enterprise and enrolls in school but he appears to be a liar, a thief and a bully. Worf must learn to build a relationship with Alexander and learn how to be a father.  Meanwhile, the experimental ship and Soliton Wave perform beautifully at first but, something goes wrong - a power fluctuation causes the wave to go out of control, destroying the test ship and damaging the Enterprise's engines, shields and sensors. The wave, at an unexpected energy level, heads toward a populated colony at warp speed and, if it hits the colony will completely destroy it. The Enterprise must find a way to stop the wave before it is too late.  	3.0	enterprise, heads, three, help, historic, tests, new, propulsion, method, soliton, wave, would, impart, warp, drive, ship,

Although the signal leads to an uninhabited moon, Troi is convinced that there is someone still alive. Due to a magnetic storm on the moon, the Enterprise is unable to use the transporters so Riker, Troi and Data attempt to use a shuttlecraft to land on the moon on a rescue mission but, the craft is destroyed by the storm.  They are joined by O'Brien who has found a way to use the transporter for a single beaming and to rig up a booster so they may be rescued by the transporters. As they are about to beam up, the storm lets loose a lightning bolt which knocks the crew unconscious. Riker manages to come to long enough to activate the booster and they are all returned to the ship.  Shortly after their return, Data, Troi, and O'Brien begin to behave strangely and they attempt to take over the ship. When their attempted mutiny fails, they run for ten-forward where they take hostage Keiko, Worf and other crew members. Picard must find a way to free the hostages, and discover why Data, Troi and O'Brien have attempted to take over the ship.  	1.0	enterprise, encounters, emergency, signal, daedalus, class, ship,

Even in Dr. Crusher's time, this is one injury that cannot be easily mended and Worf must face the ethical choice between an experimental procedure proposed by Dr. Russell, a Klingon ritual suicide or living life as a cripple.  Worf asks Riker for his assistance in committing suicide, a ritual performed by an honorable Klingon who is irreparably injured. Riker must face his own ethical decision - help a friend to die by suicide, or help a friend to live.  Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher must find a way to deal with a doctor whose medical judgement and practice is highly unethical. Dr. Russell is a doctor that is willing to test highly experimental, untested treatments on live patients, with or without their consent, regardless of the possible results and often without attempting more traditional treatments. One of Dr. Russell's experimental treatments kills a patient, even though a more standard treatment may have saved the patient's life. On the other hand, Dr. Russell's experimental procedure for scanning and re-creating body parts, may be the only thing that can save Worf.  	1.0	aptly, named, episode, begins, worf, becoming,

The crew finds traces of Triallic Waves in the cavern and traces them back to Devidia Two where they find yet another cave - this one inhabited by beings who are slightly out of phase with our universe. Data assists Geordi in building a Sub-Space distorter to align the synchronic distortion. As Data uses the distorter, the beings inhabiting the area use a temporal distorter and Data is caught in the waves and sent to Earth in the late 19th century.  	4.0	season, ending, cliff, hanger,

Barclay for the third time in this episode. The Enterprise is sent to search for a research vessel that had been exploring a strange plasma cloud and lost contact with the Federation. Because of ionization in the cloud, the Enterprise is forced to link their transporter to the research vessel's in order to be able to transport to that ship to investigate the disappearance of its crew. Lt. Barclay turns out to be afraid of transporters but is finally convinced that there is ""nothing to be afraid of"" in the transporter. On his return voyage from the research vessel however, Barclay sees strange things floating in the beam along with him and one apparently bites him on his arm. He then begins acting rather strangely (even for him) as the crew of the Enterprise continue their investigation into the mystery of the research ship and its missing crew.

Jenolan, which had crashed while investigating the sphere. On board that ship, locked in a diagnostic loop in the transporter system they discover Captain Montgomery Scott, who had put himself and another crewmember into the transporter system to await rescue. Scotty had been on his way to a retirement planet when his transport ship crashed on the sphere. The Enterprise eventually is trapped inside the Dyson sphere with the sun about to explode and Scotty and LaForge must find a way to save the ship using the wrecked Jenolan.  The best part of this episode was watching Scotty reminisce about events from the old series (bonus points if you could name the episodes he referred to) and watching him learn about the technology 75 years after his own day as Chief Engineer. It was also nostalgic seeing the old Enterprise bridge again, even if it was on the holodeck.  	6.0	investigating, dyson, sphere, enterprise, finds, wreck, u, jenolan, crashed, investigating, sphere,

On the way back from shore leave on Malonia, the shuttlecraft carrying Picard, Guinan, Keiko and Ro gets caught in an unknown energy field. As the shuttle is about to break up, they are transported off the ship but they appear on the Enterprise's transporter pad as youngsters. Dr. Crusher must find the cause and a cure while the Enterprise races to rescue scientists on Ligos 7 who have sent out a distress signal. Upon reaching the Ligos system, the Enterprise is ambused by renegade Ferengi who are out to use the crew as slave labor and sell the Enterprise...at a high profit.  	6.0	leonard, nimoy, spock, son,

Picard attempts to learn the recorder, Dr. Crusher, with Commander Riker work on rehearsals for a play, Geordi and Data work on an experiment to tie Data in to the computer system, and Worf, Alexander and Counselor Troi enjoy themselves in a holodeck adventure set in the ""Ancient West"" sic in which Worf and Alexander are the sheriff and deputy faced with the task of bringing Eli Hollander to justice. Troi takes the role of Durango, the ""mysterious stranger just passing through town.""  Problems ensue however, when a power flux causes part of the Enterprise computer system to be replaced by part of Data's programming. The part of the computer system that's affected - the part that controls recreational activities. Dr. Crusher's play is replaced by Data's poetry, Picard's music is replaced by music Data had been recently studying, Data starts behaving oddly, and the holodeck adventure takes an unplanned, and deadly turn.  In this episode, ably directed by Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner plays six additional roles besides Data. For those playing spot the actor, Brent replaced John Pyper Ferguson as Eli Hollander, appeared as Eli's father, Frank, appeared as Hollander's two henchmen, and appeared at the end of the adventure in drag as Annie; the sixth appearance was the hardest to spot - Brent also played the man sitting in the rocker at the beginning of the holodeck adventure.

She has been kidnapped by N'Vek, a Romulan dissident, in order to help several high Romulan officials defect to the Federation while posing as a member of the Tal Shiyar (a Romulan organization which promotes ""loyalty"" within the Empire). Meanwhile, a former Federation member named DeSeve, who had previously defected to the Romulan Empire returns to the Federation and is taken on board by the Enterprise. He brings with him information from Ambassador Spock about the scheme to bring the Romulan officials to the Federation aboard a freighter. The Enterprise heads to the location where they are to meet the freighter only to find it destroyed and a Romulan warship.

Picard declines, and professor Galen leaves the ship but sends a distress call some time later when his ship is attacked by a strange vessel.

His theory is not accepted by his fellow scientists at a scientific conference which Beverly Crusher attended. However, Dr. Crusher believes in the theory and wants to give him a chance to prove himself so she invites several scientists to the Enterprise to test the theory. Only a few of all invited attend - Kurak, Jo'Bril, Christopher and T'Pan. In the first test of the device, the pilot of the shuttlecraft, Jo'Bril dies and Dr. Rega and his theory are discredited leading Beverly to an investigation of the failed experiment and Dr. Rega's subsequent mysterious death, that could cost her her career.  The shuttlecraft used for the experiment is named the ""Justman"" in honor of Bob Justman who was one an associate producer of the original Star Trek.

They have become individuals and have changed their tactics confusing the crew of the Enterprise. When one of the Borg is captured, they discover that the Borg are now lead by someone who has taught them new ideas.  Meanwhile, Data is confronted with the emergence of a new experience - emotion. While fighting the Borg, Data gets ""angry"" and kills one of the Borg and later admits that he felt ""pleasure"" in it. He is very confused by the new experiences and seeks to understand them better. When the captured Borg offers him an explanation, Data helps him escape the ship in a shuttlecraft. When the Enterprise follows, they discover the Borg on a remote planet and discover who is behind the new and deadlier Borg.
