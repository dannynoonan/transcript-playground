While en route to investigate problems on Farpoint station, the Enterprise meets the mysterious super-powered Q. Q condemns humanity and challenges them to solve the mystery at Farpoint.	"The year is 2364. Captain Jean-Luc Picard has assumed command of the new starship, the Galaxy-class USS Enterprise-D, the fifth Federation starship to bear the name Enterprise. The vessel is about to embark on its first mission to Deneb IV, beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy. Picard, in his log, notes that he is impressed with the size and complexity of the ship as he walks through the Enterprise, surveying engineering, then finally enters the bridge, manned by tactical officer Lieutenant Natasha Yar, Lieutenant Worf, Counselor Deanna Troi and Lieutenant Commander Data. Picard continues with his log, in which he reports that the ship is en route to Farpoint Station and that the ship is short in several key positions, most notably a first officer, but Picard is informed that a very experienced officer, one William T. Riker, will fill the position. Picard sits at the captain's chair and makes an off-hand comment on how Starfleet wants the crew of the Enterprise to ""snoop"" around Farpoint station, to which Data makes an inquiry into the definition of the word snoop. Picard wonders how Data, a complex android with encyclopedic knowledge does not know the meaning of a basic word like ""snoop"". Data responds that he possibly was not designed to emulate this type of Human behavior. Picard says that it means ""to spy, to sneak."" Data responds, ""Ah, to seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gum…"" ""Yes"" Picard interjects, to which Data finishes, ""…shoe."" Suddenly, Counselor Troi senses a powerful mind. The ship then goes to red alert, with the familiar alert sound blaring through the bridge. Then, conn officer Lieutenant Torres reports that there is something reading as strange on his detector circuit. A large field begins to appear in front of the Enterprise, which reads as solid. Picard calls for Yar to turn off ""that damned noise!"" and go to yellow alert. Picard orders helm to make the ship come to a full stop. Soon after controls read full stop, a white light shines on the bridge and a humanoid emerges, dressed from 16th century Europe. Picard asks the being to identify itself. The being notes that he is called ""Q"" and walks around the bridge, while Torres discreetly takes a hand phaser out from the bottom of his console. Q, however, senses this and freezes Torres before he can fire. Q, after showing his ability, warns the crew of the Enterprise to go back to Earth or they shall most certainly die. "	On the maiden mission of the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), an omnipotent being known as Q challenges the crew to discover the secret of a mysterious base in an advanced and civilized fashion.

The Enterprise rendezvouses with the science vessel U.S.S. Tsiolkovsky and find the entire crew dead. Unknowingly, they bring back to the Enterprise the strange infection that caused the crew of the science vessel to go crazy. The crew of the Enterprise discover that the cure found by the first Enterprise for this disease does not work due to a mutation in the virus.  "	"The USS Enterprise-D has been assigned to investigate a loss of contact with the SS Tsiolkovsky, which had been assigned to observe the final days of a dying red supergiant star. Opening communications, the Enterprise bridge crew hear a woman speaking in a seductive voice. In confusion, Data requests for the woman to repeat her message, in which she states that a huge 'blowout' is about to occur. Many other crew on the Tsiolkovsky begin laughing and are shouting encouragement before a large explosive sound is heard followed by silence. Captain Picard requests a report. Data responds stating that the crew had just opened an emergency hatch. This prompts Commander Riker to stand up and head to the turbolift, followed by Data, Geordi La Forge and Natasha Yar, to beam over to the Tsiolkovsky. As they leave, Worf reports to Picard that sensor scans have revealed that there are no life signs on board the ship. On the Tsiolkovsky, the ship is on red alert as the away team spreads out to investigate the ship. The corridors are quiet, but are littered with discarded items and food. The walls are also covered with phaser burn marks. Data states that the mess in the corridor indicates a ""wild party"", to which Riker agrees. They approach a distorted screen which Riker makes out as the bridge. Data successfully repairs the screen to clear the static, to which they see the bridge is empty of all loose items, and people; and is open to space; the emergency hatch was indeed blown. Riker remarks the crew were all sucked out into space, to which Data corrects him, stating that they were instead ""blown out."" Yar contacts Riker from engineering, stating that ten people present there are frozen. Someone had modified the environmental controls, venting all heat into space. In the crew quarters, La Forge witnesses many nude or barely clothed bodies, all frozen. He enters the bathroom and opens the shower to find a fully-clothed woman frozen, who falls in his arms. La Forge feels something strange in his hands and rubs his fingers together after gently letting the frozen woman fall to the ground. Riker contacts the Enterprise to submit his report. He reports to Picard that the crew – all 80 people, are dead. "	The crew of the Enterprise is infected with a virus that causes them to behave as though they were intoxicated.

The Logonian leader kidnaps Tasha as part of the traditions of his planet. Eventually she is forced to fight a battle to the death with the wife of the leader in order to gain her freedom and the vaccine.	"The USS Enterprise-D has traveled to Ligon II for a vaccine, found only on that planet, that is needed to cure a plague, Anchilles fever, on the Federation planet Styris IV. Captain Picard has to negotiate with the Ligonian leader Lutan for the vaccine. Picard, Troi and Riker meet up with Natasha Yar in cargo bay 1 to greet the Ligonians. While travelling to the cargo bay in a turbolift, Riker and Troi inform Picard that the Ligonians are a closely humanoid race with similarities to Human culture, as well as an extremely proud race of people with a highly-structured society. The Ligonians beam over with a red carpet, which is rolled out before Lutan himself beams over. Picard greets him, and Lutan introduces his secondary Hagon. Picard then introduces his crew. Immediately, Lutan is intrigued that a woman, Yar, is in charge of security on the Enterprise. Hagon approaches Picard with a sample of the vaccine, and brushes Yar out of the way when she tries to take it from him. Yar then throws Hagon to the ground before inspecting the vaccine and giving it to Picard. Troi recommends not to apologize for the incident as the Ligonians would view this as a sign of weakness. Picard thanks Lutan and invites them to stay for entertainment. Lutan agrees, however, once the Enterprise crew leaves, he tells Hagon that Yar may be ""just what he needs."" "	When the leader of an alien culture takes a romantic interest in Lt. Yar, he claims her for his own, to the dismay of his own wife, who, in turn, challenges Tasha in a fight to the death.

Both ships are rendered immobile as they pass an unknown solar system. Believing each other responsible for the immobility, they discuss surrender. Meanwhile, an Enterprise probe discovers that a force-field on the nearby planet is actually responsible and a joint expedition of Ferengi and Federation personnel, beam down to explore. They encounter a mysterious being known as Portal who presents them a test.	The USS Enterprise-D is in pursuit of a Ferengi vessel suspected of stealing a Federation-owned T-9 energy converter from Gamma Tauri IV. The mission is also a long-awaited opportunity to encounter the Ferengi, who have never established visual contact with the Federation. The pursuit ends when the Ferengi ship gets close to a planet in the Delphi Ardu system and goes to sub-warp speed, possibly suffering a power surge and damage to their engines. After a while, it opens fire on the Enterprise, causing her minimal damage. Captain Picard chooses not to return fire, arguing that the Ferengi are just reacting to the Enterprise's pursuit. Soon after, however, the Enterprise also suffers a power system failure, becoming immobilized with phasers and shields off-line. 	The Enterprise makes a confrontational first contact with the piratical Ferengi race as their two ships are ensnared by a presumed dead planet ready to judge them.

During the experiment, something goes wrong and the Enterprise ends up in a place where thoughts become real. The assistant from a race of ""travelers"" with the scientific capabilities far beyond ours who tour the universe seeking those with potential. The traveler confides to Picard that Wesley is one of those beings with potential and should be guided and helped to grow. It is as a result of these comments, plus the knowledge and help that Wesley provides in Engineering that prompts Picard to make Crusher an acting ensign.  "	The USS Enterprise-D has rendezvoused with the Excelsior-class starship USS Fearless in order to take on a Starfleet propulsion specialist who will perform an upgrade on the ship's warp drive. He has already performed the upgrade on the Fearless, as well as the USS Ajax. Both these ships reported a notable increase in engine efficiency. Riker, however, is not convinced. He and Data have run a controlled test of the formulae that the engineer, Kosinski, has sent over, and found them to have no effect. Picard reasons that there's no harm in letting him come over and attempt the upgrade, especially since it doesn't change the hardware.  Riker is still skeptical, so Picard sends him to meet Kosinski when he beams aboard, along with his assistant. Riker, Troi, and Chief Engineer Argyle go to meet him in the transporter room. Kosinski is pompous and arrogant. He asks why the captain isn't there to meet him and demands to be taken to engineering. As he leaves, Troi comments to Riker that Kosinski is as he appears – loud and arrogant – but she can sense nothing from his assistant, not even his presence. Riker tells Troi to stay concerned, as the safety of the Enterprise may be entrusted to the two of them. 	Everyone accurately pegs a visiting propulsion scientist as a charlatan, but only Wesley Crusher recognizes his alien assistant as the real deal.

As they pass, a bolt of energy strikes Worf and passes from crewman to crewman, killing one crewman and eventually taking over Picard's mind.	"The USS Enterprise-D has begun orbiting the two major planets in the Beta Renner system, Antica and Selay. The two species of those worlds, the Anticans and the Selay, have both achieved space flight and they have applied to become members of the United Federation of Planets. However, the two species are mortal enemies. The Enterprise has been ordered to transport both peoples to a neutral planet called Parliament, in the hopes of resolving their conflicts. On the Enterprise, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker and Lieutenant Natasha Yar stand in the transporter room wearing their dress uniforms awaiting the delegates. The delegates from Selay beam on board. Picard introduces himself to Ssestar, a male Selay. Riker is about to lead them to their accommodations, but Ssestar insists that the Selay's quarters be upwind from the Anticans and be as far away as possible. Riker attends to this and leads them to their quarters. After the delegation leaves the transporter room, Yar tells Picard that neither species seems like promising Federation candidates. Picard agrees and believes that Parliament's peacemakers may have difficulty satisfying the two species' needs. Later on, the Enterprise leaves orbit of Selay on course for Parliament. On the bridge, Lieutenant Commander Data notes that his sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead of the Enterprise. On the viewscreen, an enormous cloud is shown. Data notes that it is also traveling at warp speed. Picard, intrigued, orders Data to make a close sensor pass on the cloud, then jump back to warp speed so they are still on schedule for Parliament.  In sensor maintenance, Lieutenants Geordi La Forge and Worf are running diagnostics on sensor assemblies. La Forge wonders why Worf is so interested in routine maintenance on sensors. Worf tells him it is simple, because Picard wants his junior officers to ""learn, learn, learn"". Yar signals sensor maintenance to see if there are any problems with systems, since they are making a close sensor pass. La Forge replies that all equipment is online and functioning perfectly. The Enterprise begins scanning the cloud. Worf, while working at a console, hears a strange noise. He goes over to investigate, but his body is struck by swirling blue energy. The energy discharges from Worf and he falls to the floor, unconscious. La Forge rushes over to Worf's side and taps his combadge, signaling a medical emergency. "	While distracted by two antithetical races applying for Federation membership, the Enterprise picks up a sentient entity that can alternately possess either man or machinery.

Wesley falls afoul of their justice system which demands that anyone who commits a crime be executed immediately. Picard must then choose between Wesley and obeying the Prime Directive. To complicate matters, a strange alien presence surrounds the world and is worshipped by the Edo as a God. It has unlimited power and does not want Picard interfering with the Edo's laws.	"Upon his return back from the surface, Commander Riker tells everyone on the bridge with great enthusiasm about the planet; he explains that the planet's inhabitants, the Edo, are almost identical to Humans, and that it is a class M planet, beautiful and stunning. Doctor Crusher suggests shore leave for everyone, stating that nothing is better than fresh air and open spaces. Lieutenant Natasha Yar states that the inhabitants' laws and customs are pretty straightforward and nothing out of the ordinary. What is special about them, however, says Geordi La Forge, is their great affection for others… and the fact that the Edo make love at the drop of a hat. ""Any hat,"" Yar adds. The doctor's suggestion of shore leave is approved but only for a small group at first. Among them is Wesley Crusher, whom the captain personally designates as the one to evaluate this planet as a place for young people to relax. If their scans and observations support the report from the away team, then shore leave for the entire crew will be approved, says Captain Picard. He just hopes the planet it is not too good to be true. Before they beam down, however, Commander Data continues to receive a faulty reading in the sensors, indicating there is something in orbit, despite the fact that nothing appears on the viewscreen. "	On an alien planet, young Wesley Crusher commits a transgression - small by our standards but mandatorily punishable by death in theirs.

Bok returns the derelict Stargazer to the Federation as a gift but has secretly placed a mind altering device on board. Using this device, Bok attempts to get revenge on Picard by causing him to believe that he still commands the Stargazer and the Enterprise is the alien ship.	"In response to an order from Starfleet, the USS Enterprise-D has been sent to the Xendi Sabu system to rendezvous with a Ferengi Alliance vessel. For three days there has been no message from the Ferengi except for ""Stand by, Enterprise."" Dr. Crusher comes to see Captain Picard in his quarters, where he complains of feeling fatigued and having a terrible headache. Crusher is so surprised at his suggested diagnosis of a headache she says ""A what?"" and an annoyed Picard repeats his diagnosis. Crusher assures Picard she knows what a headache is but says that she doesn't encounter them often. She examines him and can find nothing wrong but tells him to come to sickbay all the same. He begins to refuse when she orders him to go and says ""You've got an order to report to sickbay from the only person aboard this ship who can give you an order."" Just then the Ferengi hail the Enterprise. Picard returns to the bridge and talks with the Ferengi captain, DaiMon Bok, over the Enterprise's viewscreen. Bok claims to know Picard, but Picard doesn't recognize Bok at all. He wants to meet Picard in person, so despite being wary of his intentions, Picard agrees to meet him aboard the Enterprise. "	Beware Ferengi bearing gifts. Capt. Picard receives the Stargazer, a ship considered lost that he once commanded.

This time, Q transports the entire bridge crew except Picard to a desolate planet and forces them to play a deadly game. The game's true purpose is to test Riker to see if he is worthy of receiving the power of the ""Q"".  "	Having dropped Deanna Troi off at Starbase G-6 for a shuttlecraft ride to Betazed, the USS Enterprise-D is fortunately close to the Sigma III solar system, when its Federation colony transmits an urgent call for medical help. An accidental explosion has devastated a mining operation there. There are 504 colonists at the site. Doctor Beverly Crusher is hurriedly preparing her medical staff to treat the massive number of injured colonists. En route to the mining colony at warp 9.1, the Enterprise is once again trapped in Q's force field grid. Q appears as an Aldebaran serpent on the bridge of the Enterprise, and informs the bridge crew that the Q Continuum, after studying their recent contact with Humanity, are mostly impressed by them and wishes to discuss it. Picard urgently asks to wait until they've completed their mission, but Q demands he abandon it. He then changes into a Starfleet admiral. 	The Enterprise encounters Q again, and he tempts Riker by endowing him with the powers of the Q.

There, Troi meets her fiancee of a pre-arranged marriage for the first time and is torn between her life in Starfleet and her devotion to her family and customs.	"The USS Enterprise-D arrives at the planet Haven. Captain Picard notes that the planet has been said to mend souls and heal broken hearts. Lieutenant Commander Data tells the captain that those legends are completely unsupported by fact; but Picard believes that such legends are the spice of the universe, as they sometimes can become true. Meanwhile, Commander Riker sits in his quarters, relaxing to miniature holograms of attractive women playing harps. Just then, security chief Lieutenant Yar informs the commander that his presence is requested in Transporter room 1. ""Sorry, ladies. Duty calls"", he says before deactivating the holographic interface. Arriving at the transporter, Riker asks what he is needed for. She answers that an object is being beamed up to the Enterprise but does not know what it is. The transporter chief informs them that Haven has approved the beam up and the object materializes on the transporter pad. Riker finds it odd looking. Counselor Troi then enters, asking what is going on. The box's ""face"" opens its eyes and states ""I hold a message for Deanna Troi. Lwaxana Troi and the honorable Miller family will soon arrive. The momentous day is close at hand. Rejoice! Ha, ha, ha!"" After frightening Yar, a compartment underneath the ""face"" opens, spilling jewels onto the transporter pad. Troi tells Lieutenant Yar that the jewels are ""bonding gifts"", or what Humans would call wedding presents. When asked by Commander Riker who is getting married, Troi says ""I am."" "	While on a mission to a planet called Haven, Counselor Troi meets her husband to be, a marriage arranged by her father years before, as the Enterprise encounters a ship far deadlier than any combat could provide.

Picard becomes the investigator involved in his latest case. Meanwhile, an alien probe shakes the ship and damages the holodeck controls accidentally turning the fantasy world into a deadly trap. This episode won a Peabody award.  "	The USS Enterprise-D is en route to a meeting with the Jarada on a diplomatic mission. Captain Picard has been appointed by Starfleet to attempt to establish a relationship with them; however, the captain must recite their complicated greeting to them, in their native tongue, without any errors, or otherwise the meeting will fail. The captain and Deanna Troi have been practicing the speech in his ready room for hours. Troi says that the captain should take a break and suggests trying out the new holodeck upgrades. Picard's face brightens when he remembers that he's been looking forward to trying out the new Dixon Hill holodeck program. Troi tells the captain that the program has been installed and is waiting. After entering the holodeck, Picard is impressed by the upgrades. He is met by a lady, Mrs. Jessica Bradley, in Dixon Hill's office, who claims someone is trying to kill her – Picard has been hired.

In a hidden cave, they find another robot, Data's twin brother Lore, and revive him. They discover, almost too late, that Lore is a megalomaniac and out to destroy the Enterprise.	"While passing by Omicron Theta en route to their next assignment, the USS Enterprise-D stops to investigate the site of Data's discovery. However, Data is in his quarters practicing sneezing. Wesley Crusher walks in on Data pretending to sneeze in front of a mirror and asks him if he has a cold. Data has never heard of such thing (at least not in reference to an illness) so Wesley says ""It's a disease my mom says people used to get."" Data acknowledges this fact, but presses that Humans sneeze for other reasons and he'd like to learn how to do it so he will better ""fit in"" with the crew. Wesley wonders out loud how Data could be practicing sneezing in a time like this; they're about to arrive at his home planet. Data clarifies that he is excited to see his point of origin, but that he is also interested in sneezing. They leave for the bridge. The crew learns of an entire Earth colony that disappeared from the planet twenty-six years ago, and the whole planet now appears dead. Riker leads an away team that beams down to the spot where Data was found by crewmembers from the USS Tripoli. For some reason, Data has been given the memories of all 411 colonists, and he is interested in learning why.

It was disabled by a collision with an asteroid, and there are no life signs on board, but three escape pods have been discovered missing. The Enterprise travels to Angel I, the nearest class M planet, to search for the freighter's survivors. Angel I is a female-dominated society, ruled by six elected mistresses and a leader known simply as ""the Elected One"". It has been 62 years since the last Federation contact with the planet. The Enterprise hails the planet, and Captain Picard suggests Troi speak with the Elected One, Mistress Beata. Although initially wary, she agrees to let an away team beam down to visit the planet.

After the crew, except for Riker and Picard, leave the ship, the Binars hijack it to return to their home planet to save their computers from the effects of a supernova.	"The USS Enterprise-D has arrived and is preparing to dock at Starbase 74, in orbit around the planet Tarsas III, for a maintenance check and upgrades. The ship docks, and Captain Picard and Commander Riker go to meet the maintenance crews. The crews' leader, Commander Quinteros, greets them and tells them he was in charge of the team who constructed the Enterprise. Also with him are the Bynars, two aliens named One Zero and Zero One who work as a unified pair – neither male nor female. They have recently completed a successful upgrade to the computer aboard the USS Wellington, and will be upgrading the computers on the Enterprise, as well as making repairs to the holodeck. Riker and Picard discuss the Bynars on the way to the bridge. Apparently, over time they have become so interconnected with the master computer on their home planet that their thought patterns are as close to binary code as is possible. On their way back to the bridge, the two discuss their plans for the downtime. Picard plans to relax with an old novel in his quarters, but Riker hasn't decided yet, as he doesn't manage his time off very well. ""Something'll turn up. It always does"", he tells Picard. On the bridge, Wesley Crusher is watching the Bynars work. They have been joined by two more of their species. Picard goes to his ready room, and Riker tells Wesley to keep an eye on the Bynars, as he doesn't altogether trust them. He then leaves to take a walk around the ship.

Jake was short just 32 points, but says it is okay and wishes Wes the best, though he appears troubled as Wes leaves for Transporter room 8. The USS Enterprise-D is in orbit around Relva VII, where Wesley is taking the Starfleet Academy entrance exam. Captain Picard's old friend, Admiral Gregory Quinn is also at Relva and he requests to beam aboard immediately. He brings Lieutenant Commander Dexter Remmick with him, and wants a private meeting with Picard, on official business, much to the confusion of both Picard and Commander Riker. The three officers go directly to the ready room. 	Picard finds himself facing a strenuous test of his loyalty to Starfleet, one which the other members of the crew are struggling to cope with, whilst Wesley faces an equally challenging entrance exam at Starfleet Academy.

The Klingons claim to be have been passengers on the ship but turn out to be dissidents, opposed to the Federation-Klingon peace. They attempt to get Worf to help them when a Klingon cruiser enters the area and demands the return of the criminals.	Starfleet Command sends a communication to the USS Enterprise-D about a disturbance in the Neutral Zone, a battle. There are no Federation vessels in the area, and Commander William T. Riker suggests that the Ferengi are involved. On arriving at the location of the battle, they find a vessel adrift without power. Data scans the debris from the explosions and speculates that the weapons used in the battle may have been Romulan in origin. The drifting vessel is identified as the Talarian freighter Batris, a cargo vessel. Riker has an away team consisting of Data, La Forge and himself beam over to the Batris after Worf detects possible life signs aboard. 	The Enterprise searches for answers as to why three Klingon warriors were the only survivors aboard a freighter just inside the Neutral Zone which was seemingly attacked by a Ferengi ship.

Automated salesmen and weapons display systems still function and the away team is forced to fight for their lives against weapons that keep getting more sophisticated and intelligent as time passes. Meanwhile, in orbit around the planet, Geordi in command of the Enterprise is forced to fight another weapons system with the capability to cloak itself.	Arriving at Minos in the Lorenze Cluster to investigate the disappearance of the light cruiser USS Drake, the USS Enterprise-D enters orbit. Data explains to the bridge crew that the Minosians became famous during the Ersalrope Wars as arms merchants, manufacturing and selling highly advanced weaponry – to both sides in the war.  Discovering no life signs on the planet's surface more evolved than plants or animals, they are surprised by a hail from a peddler, which is soon realized to be an automated message from the time of the Wars. Commander Riker, Natasha Yar, and Data transport down to the planet's surface to investigate, Picard cautioning them that if the automated message system is still functioning, then there may well be automated weapons systems as well. 	The Enterprise encounters a planet long dead, but technical equipment still functions for the purpose of selling off its arsenal, along with self sufficiency.

When the Enterprise locates the shuttle interference prevents them from using their sensors or transporters to beam up the two occupants. The away team find an alien named Armus which appears like an oil slick but is able to assume humanoid shape at will. Armus blocks their path and prevents them from rescuing their comrades. During the encounter, Armus taunts the crew as they attempt to reach the shuttle.	The USS Enterprise-D is traveling through the Zed Lapis sector where it will rendezvous with shuttlecraft 13, carrying Counselor Deanna Troi, who is returning from a conference, along with the shuttle pilot, Lieutenant Ben Prieto. As the engineering crew is conducting maintenance of the ship's dilithium crystals, the ship is flying at impulse, with the main engines deactivated. On the bridge, Lieutenant Worf tells Lieutenant Natasha Yar that deep space probes have picked up no vessels or debris within three light years. Worf then shifts the conversation towards the martial arts competition happening on the Enterprise-D in three days. He asks Yar if she is ready. She replies that she needs some practice with the Mishiama wristlock and break, and if she can use it on Worf, she can use it on anybody, an assumption Worf promptly assures her is valid. He then asks who she is facing, and Yar says her first opponent is science officer Swenson. Worf says that she will easily defeat him. However Yar is more concerned about being beaten by Lt. Minnerly, a skilled kickboxer. Worf then boosts her confidence by telling her that she is heavily favored in the ship's pool to win. Yar asks Worf if he placed a bet on her. Worf replies that it is a sure thing. Yar then looks at Worf with a smile. Worf, embarrassed, moves away.  Helmsman Lieutenant Geordi La Forge reports to Captain Picard that the Enterprise-D will meet up with the shuttle in just over an hour. Picard comments how it will be good to have Troi back aboard, a sentiment Commander Riker agrees with. Suddenly, Worf receives an emergency distress call from the shuttle. The shuttle's computer is severely damaged and impulse engines are off-line. Prieto can't even tell what their current location is. Picard calls down to main engineering and asks chief engineer Lieutenant Commander Leland T. Lynch how long it would take to restore warp drive.  When Lynch complains that he's currently in the middle of re-aligning the dilithium crystals, Picard tells him there is an emergency and they urgently need warp drive. Lynch initially says it'll be more than twenty minutes, and Picard berates him, telling Lynch that they don't have that much time. Lynch promises to re-align the crystals by hand to get warp drive restarted immediately. La Forge then tells Prieto that he's coming dangerously close to a planet, which Prieto confirms. Lieutenant Commander Data reports that the shuttle is near Vagra II, an uninhabited planet. Picard calls down to engineering again and Lynch tells him that although he offers no guarantees, he's working on it and it'll be about three minutes. Just then, Prieto reports that the shuttle is now out of control and has been caught in Vagra II's gravity, to the grave concern of the bridge crew. 	Counselor Troi is held captive on a deserted planet by a slick, black, oily, sentient and immortal puddle of evil.

To close a rift to another dimension accidentally opened by the experiments, the away team must shutdown the experiment by dropping a specific amount of antimatter into the rift at a specific time. The scientist's wife turns out to be one of Picard's old lovers whom Picard failed to meet at a rendezvous in Paris 22 years ago.	The USS Enterprise-D is on its way to Sarona VIII for some much needed shore leave. Captain Jean-Luc Picard is getting a head start by fencing with Lieutenant Dean. Although he loses the first point, he wins the second. As Dean congratulates him, time loops, and the moment between them is repeated. When the captain and Dean notice this, Picard hails Riker, who confirms that it also occurred on the bridge. Picard goes to the bridge, where Data reports a moment in time repeated itself. Worf receives an automated distress call from the Pegos Minor system from Paul Manheim, calling for help and directing them to a set of coordinates. Picard remembers that Manheim left Earth fifteen years previously, along with a team of scientists, to perform experiments on non-linear time. It must be related, and he orders the helm to travel there immediately at warp 8. 	A scientist's experiment in time goes awry, reuniting Picard with an old flame, now married to the scientist.

The message is from Keel, an old friend of Picard's who asks to meet him on a nearby mining planet. Picard beams down to find the captains of several ships waiting there. Keel and the other captains, after ascertaining Picard is who they think he is, tells him about a suspected conspiracy within Starfleet citing a strange pattern of orders from Command as evidence. They urge him to be careful. After leaving the planet, the Enterprise comes upon the debris of Keel's ship. Picard asks Data to review the last few months of orders issued by Starfleet. Data reports that there has been an unusual amount of changing of people within the command areas of Starfleet. Picard orders the ship back to Earth where they discover several admirals, including Picard's friend Quinn have been infected by parasitic creatures.	The USS Enterprise-D is en route for the planet Pacifica for a scientific mission. Commander Riker, along with the rest of the crew, is looking forward to seeing the blue waters and beaches that make the planet a jewel of the galaxy. On the bridge, Geordi La Forge is telling a joke to Data, who, after going into detail of why it is funny, starts to laugh rather unconvincingly before stopping and returning to his console. While talking to Riker, Counselor Troi says that she is most looking forward to taking a swim while visiting Pacifica. After asking Worf if he will do the same, he remarks that he finds swimming to be too much like bathing. A moment later, Data detects a code 47 transmission coming in – meant for the commanding officer's eyes only. Asleep in his quarters, Captain Jean-Luc Picard is contacted by Riker and is told that the ship is receiving a code 47 emergency message from one Walker Keel, an old friend of Picard's who is captain of the Ambassador-class USS Horatio. Keel asks Picard for a secret rendezvous on the abandoned mining colony on Dytallix B. Even though it is a secured channel, Keel says to Picard that he cannot tell him what this is all about and insists they meet face to face. 	After diverting to a secret meeting with an old friend and some of Starfleet's finest commanders, Picard finds the Horatio blown to bits just hours after the meeting and he returns the Enterprise to Earth looking for answers.

It is Lieutenant Commander Data's first official game, but he has studied up on the subject and explains it in detail as the cards are dealt. Doctor Pulaski announces a bet, which the rest of the staff calls. Data bets ten, as he holds the highest hand, whereas Pulaski and Lieutenant La Forge fold. The cards are dealt, and Riker's new card is the five of hearts, as we see three hearts, compared to Data's pair of queens, ace high. Data bets five cautiously, whereas O'Brien calls, but Riker raises five more. Data calls, but O'Brien folds. The cards are dealt a final time, and Riker receives a four of hearts, which causes a moan from the others – Riker may have a flush. Data bets ten, but Riker raises another ten. This causes Data to peek at his face-down card, which is a queen, indicating he has three of a kind. Data comments about Riker's facial expression being a ""poker face"", but Riker asks if Data is ""playing or not?"". Data hesitates and then folds. Riker reveals his face-down card as the two of spades, which raises a resounding groan from the table. Confused, Data doesn't understand how Riker could have won – as he had nothing toward a winning hand – but La Forge points out to Data Riker's valid play and that he did win, in bluffing Data. Captain Picard, while sitting and having tea on the station, encounters Captain Phillipa Louvois, whom he has not seen in ten years.

Shortly after the arrival of the Enterprise, the Yamato explodes and a Romulan ship uncloaks. After examining the logs of the Yamato, it becomes clear that the Romulans were not responsible for the destruction of the ship. The captain of the Yamato had apparently found the legendary planet of Iconia and his ship was infected by a computer virus transmitted by a probe from that planet. That virus was apparently the cause of the system failures and the final destruction. Unfortunately, since the Enterprise downloaded the logs from the Yamato's computers, it too has the same virus. Picard must travel to Iconia in the hopes of finding a cure to the virus.	"The USS Enterprise responds to an urgent call from Captain Donald Varley, an old friend of Captain Picard. Varley's ship, the USS Yamato, the sister ship of the Enterprise, has been plagued by a series of system malfunctions while in the Romulan Neutral Zone. Upon rendezvousing with the Enterprise, Varley explains to Picard that he was investigating ""rumors… that started making the Iconians sound a lot less like legend"" and had, in fact, located the planet Iconia in the Neutral Zone.  As Varley continues through the Enterprise's viewscreen, he reveals his goal of preventing the Romulans from gaining Iconian technology. However, his transmission to the Enterprise keeps cutting in and out. Worf detects a failure in the Yamato's antimatter containment chamber, and Picard desperately tries to warn Varley of the impending catastrophe, but the transmission is too garbled for Varley to make out his warnings. Seconds later, the Yamato explodes and all 1,000+ crew members and their families are killed with the saucer section of its ship disintegrating, all watched by a stunned Enterprise bridge crew. Meanwhile, a Romulan D'deridex-class warbird enters the Enterprise's sensor range.

On the planet is apparently one single building which the away team discovers is modeled after the Hotel Royale from an old Earth novel.	The USS Enterprise-D enters orbit of the eighth planet of a previously unmapped solar system, Theta 116. This diversion was caused by a report from a Klingon cruiser regarding the discovery of a strange vessel in the atmosphere of the planet below. The Enterprise has arrived to investigate. Initial scans of the planet by Geordi La Forge show it to be quite inhospitable: nitrogen, methane, liquid neon, surface temperature −291 °Celsius, and wind speeds up to 312 meters per second. These scans also reveal debris in orbit of the planet. Commander William T. Riker asks to be kept informed so that they might resume their mission in a timely fashion.  Riker visits Captain Jean-Luc Picard in his ready room to report only to find Picard puzzling over Fermat's last theorem. Picard's interest in this theorem goes beyond the difficulty of the puzzle; he also feels humbled that despite their advanced 24th century technology, they are still unable to solve a problem set forth by a man who had no computer. At this point, Riker informs Picard of the debris they found in the atmosphere and advises that it be beamed aboard. A few minutes later, Miles O'Brien and Riker are down in the transporter room targeting the debris. Picard joins them and Riker tells him that they have found a ship fragment with markings on it. Picard asks what kinds of markings. Riker admits that he does not know, then orders the piece beamed aboard. He and O'Brien then pick up the large chunk of hull beamed aboard from the transporter pad and turn it to face the captain, revealing the word NASA and the flag of the old United States of America (notably containing 52 stars) on the panel. Picard then marvels at the puzzle that they have discovered. 	Worf, Data, and Riker find themselves trapped in a re-creation of a poorly written novel.

In the future timeline, the Enterprise apparently was destroyed with Picard the only survivor. The Enterprise now must discover what caused the destruction and how to prevent it.	"En route to the Endicor system, Commander Riker is in his quarters busily preparing an omelet made from 'Owon eggs he picked up at Starbase 73. Soon, Data, La Forge, Worf, and Pulaski show up for the meal. Pulaski observes that Riker has a practiced hand in cooking. Riker tells her that it is due to his father, as he left him to do all the cooking after the death of his mother. La Forge and Pulaski take the first bites of their omelets but are immediately disgusted while Data observes. However, Worf is rapidly eating the omelet, which he describes as ""delicious"". Soon after, Captain Picard calls Riker to the bridge.  The USS Enterprise-D has encountered a Starfleet shuttlecraft adrift in space, which is odd because at this time there should not be any Federation vessels.  "	The Enterprise comes across its own shuttlecraft adrift in space - a duplicate - with an unconscious duplicate Capt. Picard inside.

Sent to brief him on the new command is his estranged father.	"The USS Enterprise-D is en route to Starbase Montgomery in the hope that the base can provide a consultation regarding minor readout anomalies in engineering. While Lieutenant Commander Data believes the anomalies are insignificant, both Riker and Picard think it is necessary to investigate the issue. Data suggests that the best solution would be to reprogram the system to correct the readout variables, with which Picard agrees, but with the Enterprise heading to Starbase Montgomery anyway, they should have the issue checked out by the starbase's maintenance personnel. Riker points out that Montgomery was not in their mission itinerary. Picard mentions that a layover will not hurt crew morale and that he just received some priority personnel transfer directives. Riker asks if personnel are boarding or disembarking. At that moment, Ensign Wesley Crusher calls the captain from the bridge to inform him that they are within hailing range of the starbase. Picard orders them to proceed at half impulse and asks Riker to join him in the observation lounge for a moment. In the observation lounge, Riker enters the room to a waiting Picard. Picard recalls Riker's impressive manual docking maneuver when he first arrived on the Enterprise. Picard offers Riker a belated congratulations in the way of informing him that the commanding officer of the USS Aries is retiring, and that Riker has been promoted as its new captain. The Aries may have found as-yet-unconfirmed indications of an intelligent lifeform which is in the Vega-Omicron sector, where it is stationed, and which is months away at high warp. Starfleet wants to utilize Riker's impeccable exploratory and diplomatic skill to ascertain the situation.  Picard informs Riker that he has twelve hours to decide whether he will accept the position. Just before leaving, Picard hopes that he is not too premature and congratulates ""Captain"" Riker on his promotion. "	Riker's delight at being offered a command of the USS Aries turns to frustration when the man sent to prepare him for his mission is his estranged father; Worf's behavior leads Wesley to delve into Klingon tradition.

Talking with her, much less saving her from the seismic activity on her planet, would be a violation of the Prime Directive. Meanwhile, Wesley is given his first command, in charge of the team doing the planetary mineral surveys and discovers the difficulties of being in command.	The USS Enterprise-D is studying a series of planetary breakups in the Selcundi Drema sector. Planet after planet has been reduced to rubble, apparently as a result of natural geologic cataclysms. The Enterprise's mission is to find an answer to this mystery. Captain Picard prepares to ride an Arabian horse on the holodeck, with Troi watching. Just as he is about to climb onto the horse, Riker calls him to the bridge to view geological calamities on a once thriving ecosystem on the planet in the first system they entered. Now, there is nothing. 	Data befriends an alien girl in distress, breaking the Prime Directive, while Wesley commands his first team.

He tells Picard that they need him as a guide because humanity is unprepared for what awaits them. When Picard insists they are, Q hurls the Enterprise several thousand light-years away where they encounter the Borg, a race of cyborgs.	"New ensign Sonya Gomez orders a hot chocolate from a replicator in engineering. While doing so, La Forge passes, and the two converse, La Forge noting Gomez' polite manners toward the replicator, saying ""please"" and ""thank you"". Gomez wonders why not, and explains she does this as the replicator is listed under ""intelligent circuitry"". After all, she notes that working with so much artificial intelligence can be dehumanizing and she combats this with using simple courtesy. As the two walk to main engineering, La Forge urges the talkative and enthusiastic Gomez to relax. After arriving, he notes to her that she is carrying food or drink in the premises of engineering, which is forbidden. As she turns around to go finish it elsewhere, she spills some all over Picard's uniform. La Forge tells Picard that Gomez just transferred to the Enterprise from Starbase 173 and accepts responsibility for what just happened. Picard, though not entirely unvexed, welcomes Gomez to the ship. Picard excuses himself to change his uniform. He walks to the nearest turbolift to get to his quarters. However, when the doors open again, he finds that the turbolift did not make it to his quarters, but is inside a shuttlecraft far away from the USS Enterprise-D. He quickly realizes that he has been kidnapped by Q. Picard reminds Q about their agreement from a year earlier, when Q agreed never to trouble Picard's ship again; Q points out that they are nowhere near the Enterprise. Q is, however, kind enough to clean Picard's uniform with his abilities. "	Q tries to prove that Picard needs him as part of their crew by hurling the Enterprise 7,000 light years away where they encounter the Borg for the first time.

Wesley is going there to take his Starfleet exams, while Picard is going for delicate heart surgury. Meanwhile, the Enterprise receives a distress call from the Pakleds, a race of beings who steal technology.	Captain Picard is having a discussion with his chief medical officer Doctor Pulaski in her office about Picard's artificial heart, which needs to be replaced on Starbase 515. This procedure should have been performed earlier, but Picard has ignored it for far too long. When Doctor Pulaski proposes performing the procedure on board the Enterprise herself along with her medical staff, Picard refuses, being concerned with his image, and reluctantly agrees to make the trip to Starbase 515. Wesley Crusher is also going to Starbase 515 to take Starfleet exams, which Data found quite elementary. Crusher is surprised when Picard tells him that he will be traveling with him and asks Geordi La Forge and Sonya Gomez what he should talk about while traveling with Picard. Commander Riker is wondering why Picard is taking this trip, since he knows that Picard was looking forward to seeing the Epsilon pulsar cluster, when the Enterprise receives a distress call from the Rhomboid Dronegar Sector 006. 	With Picard away for routine surgery, the Enterprise responds to an apparent distress call from a Pakled vessel.

The first colony, has rejected technology and returned back-to-nature. The ship carrying the second colony had apparently crash-landed and only five colonists survived. To keep their colony alive, they turned to cloning but are now in desperate need of new DNA.	On the bridge of the USS Enterprise-D, Worf is at his post at tactical when he suddenly begins to feel uncomfortable. He is fighting the odd sensations the best he can. Captain Picard arrives on the bridge and summons Commander Riker into the ready room. There, the captain talks about a meeting he had with Admiral Moore. He then plays on his monitor for his first officer the subject of the meeting: a series of sound pulses that had begun transmitting one month ago. Riker is quick to discern the sound as an antiquated distress signal; Starbase Research had spent hours coming to the same conclusion.  A computer lookup reveals the distress signal as one that had been used by the European Hegemony, a 22nd century alliance that had been one of the earliest progressions towards a United Earth. However, further research into deep space launches in that timeframe draws a blank. That leaves only one option: go to the Ficus sector and figure out who needs help. But as they emerge from the ready room, Picard and Riker are surprised to see the bridge crew surrounding Worf… who has collapsed at his post. Data calls sickbay for a medical emergency and for Doctor Pulaski to come to the bridge. 	An antiquated distress signal leads to two lost 22nd century Earth colonies, each facing doom in different ways, one by fire, the other by prolonged cloning.

One of the delegates is Troi's mother who is going through a phase that causes her sex drive to increase. Lwaxana stuns everyone by deciding she is going to marry Picard. Picard meanwhile, flees to the holodeck and the escapades of Dixon Hill.	On a mission to deliver Antedian dignitaries from Antede III (who are brought aboard in a catatonic state) to a conference on Pacifica, the USS Enterprise-D is unexpectedly ordered by Starfleet to pick up Lwaxana Troi and to extend full diplomatic courtesies to her. Before they even get the order, Lwaxana has caught up with the Enterprise in a Federation transport. She is also going to the conference, representing Betazed. Lwaxana draws the ire of her daughter, Deanna, and then insinuates that Picard is having 'naughty' thoughts about her once again.  	A midlife Betazoid condition renders Ambassador Troi hot on the hunt for romance and wedlock with Captain Picard - or any man.

A Klingon ship, with a crew in suspended animation, was sent out while the Federation and Klingons were still at war. The mission of the Enterprise is to prevent the crew of that ship from awakening and rekindling an old war.	"Worf, Data, La Forge, Dr. Pulaski, and Riker are playing poker. When Worf makes a big bet, Data suggests that he doesn't fully understand the nuances of the game. Riker points out that Worf has been the biggest winner that day, implying that Data shouldn't underestimate his poker skills. Data expresses doubt that Worf's success is due to anything other than random chance. Pulaski, being the only one who doesn't fold, calls Worf's hand after the latter raises.  Worf shows her a full house, aces full of queens, which draws a whistle by La Forge.  Pulaski folds her straight and busts, while Worf rakes in the pot.  On a subsequent hand, Worf once again bets big, and La Forge says he's bluffing. Worf insists that Klingons never bluff. La Forge, however, expresses skepticism while they walk out. The poker game is interrupted before the hand can be played out, when the USS Enterprise-D receives an urgent confidential message from Starfleet Command to divert course, but without any details. ""Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we're about to face a challenge,"" Picard tells Riker before ordering the Enterprise to go to warp speed. "	The Enterprise addresses the emergency of an old Klingon ship coming out of stasis and ready to fight the Federation. A half-Human/half Klingon emissary arrives to help, who once knew Worf intimately.

Riker is placed in command of the U.S.S. Hathaway in simulated combat with the Enterprise. Riker is given his choice of crew and 48 hours to ready the ship before the battle begins. The battle is interrupted however, when a Ferengi ship appears demanding the Hathaway be turned over to them.	The USS Enterprise-D has a rendezvous with a shuttlecraft carrying the famed strategist Sirna Kolrami en route to a battle simulation in the Braslota system in which Commander Riker will command an inferior ship, the eighty-year-old USS Hathaway. Kolrami is a Zakdorn, a race which has been feared for nine millennia as having the most innately strategic minds in the known galaxy. While being briefed by Kolrami in the observation lounge, Captain Picard and Riker are at first reluctant to take part in this simulation as they believe diplomacy and exploration are the more important mandates of Starfleet, and that Starfleet itself is not a military organization. However, because of the newly-discovered Borg threat, they decide it is a good idea to hone their tactical skills so as to have as many options as possible in crisis situations.  	The crew of the Enterprise participates in war games.

An away team of Lieutenant Geordi La Forge and Commander William Riker are on the surface in an alien swamp, teeming with strange lifeforms, conducting a geological sweep. La Forge finds Riker sitting on a log, injured. Something has bitten his leg. La Forge, not taking any chances with alien biology on a world unknown to the United Federation of Planets, calls for the transporter. Transporter Chief O'Brien delays, getting an alert signal from the biofilter in the transporter, as Riker's body has been infected with some type of unidentified microbes. Doctor Pulaski is summoned, as the chief medical officer must authorize any transportation of unfiltered biomaterial. Pulaski reluctantly uses the transporter – a rare occasion for her – to beam down and verify if it is safe to bring Riker aboard. She materializes and inspects Riker's wound with her tricorder. Riker complains of no pain, but of a numbness near the bite. La Forge hasn't had any luck finding what might have infected the wound. Pulaski beams them directly to sickbay. Two medical orderlies help Riker to the bed. He tries to shrug off their help, but when he takes a step his leg suddenly gives out. 	When Commander Riker comes down with a dangerous alien infection after an away mission, the only way to treat it may be through reliving his memories.

After regaining control of the ship, the crew is perplexed by the sudden computer malfunctions encountered. Meanwhile, Wesley realizes that two tiny robots he accidentally let loose may be responsible for the mysterious problems the crew is facing.	"Wesley Crusher is asleep, lying face down on a desk in the science lab as the USS Enterprise-D orbits a red giant. Commander Riker then contacts him over the comm, jerking Crusher awake. He asks Crusher if he forgot to set his alarm, to which Crusher, realizing he is late, apologises, packs up his things, and hurriedly heads for his station. Moments later, on the bridge, Dr. Stubbs gazes out into the viewscreen as Crusher emerges from a turbolift and assumes his position at the helm. Riker asks the acting ensign what their current position is, to which he replies, ""approaching one million kilometers from the neutron star, sir"". The commander orders him to slow to one third impulse power. Stubbs then turns to Crusher and expresses his feelings of how beautiful the star is and explains how, ""over and over again, the intense gravitational pull of the neutron star sucks up the star material from the red giant and builds up on the surface until it explodes, every one hundred and ninety six years like clockwork"", and they are only eighteen hours away from experiencing it. Or eighteen hours, seven minutes and ten seconds, as Data corrects. Just then, Captain Picard enters the bridge from his ready room, and asks the doctor if he would like to make one final inspection of the egg. Dr. Stubbs replies that he has been inspecting the egg for the last twenty years and that they ""may lay it when ready"". Picard, slightly bemused by the statement, orders the launch of the probe. The shuttlebay doors are opened as Data reports they are nearing the launch site. Suddenly, something rocks the Enterprise and Dr. Stubbs goes flying across the bridge. Picard quickly orders Crusher to stabilize the Enterprise but the ship's controls aren't responding. In engineering, chief engineer La Forge reports that there is nothing wrong with the inertial dampers. Back on the bridge, Worf says they are heading straight into the path of the stellar matter. The captain orders shields up but Worf cannot; ""the shields will not respond,"" he shouts, as the ship slowly drifts away.

The Sheliak insist that a world in the Tau Cygna Five system is theirs and demand the immediate removal of humans from that system. The Enterprise does not believe that humans are on that planet due to the fact that the planet has extremely high radiation levels but travels there anyway only to discover a thriving civilization that refuses to evacuate the planet. Data has to convince the people of the planet to leave or be destroyed by the Sheliak.	"In Ten Forward, a string quartet is tuning up. Data enters carrying a violin and approaches Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher, who are sitting nearby at a table. He advises that they attend the second concert, as he will not be playing the violin, saying that although his playing is technically proficient, he has been told by his fellow performers that he lacks soul. Crusher informs Data that by telling them he is going to fail before he makes the attempt is never wise. He says he is only trying to be honest, but Picard tells him that excessive honesty can be dangerous in a leader. Data takes his place, but just as the quartet begins the first movement (""Allegro"") of Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Riker calls Picard to the bridge, forcing the Captain to depart, painfully aware that it appears he's walking out on his friend's performance. Watching Picard walk out of Ten Forward distracts Data from playing the violin, until he joins back in at another musician's prompting. When Picard gets to the bridge, he learns that the Enterprise has been contacted by the Sheliak Corporate, for the first time in 111 years. In a recorded message, set on repeat broadcast from the Shelia system, they demand that a Human colony on Tau Cygna V be removed, as this planet was ceded to the Sheliak in the Treaty of Armens. They give them four days to remove the Humans. The Federation has no record of a settlement on the planet, which is cloaked in hyperonic radiation that is lethal to Humans. Picard reasons that the Sheliak have not broken a century of silence for no reason. He knows there must be someone there, so they set course for Tau Cygna V. "	After 111 years of silence, an extremely litigious alien race asserts its agreed upon right to wipe out a Federation colony in its territory.

Almost immediately, Jeremy sees his mother who has come, seemingly from the dead, to take him down to the planet.	The USS Enterprise-D encounters a planet that appears to be uninhabited. Captain Picard sends an away team to investigate, led by Worf. Picard learns from Data that the planet was once inhabited by a race called the Koinonians, but due to a destructive war, every last person on the planet was annihilated; the civilization seems to have killed itself off.  Suddenly an accident befalls the away team; one of the members, Enterprise archaeologist Lieutenant Marla Aster, is killed when an unexploded mine detonates in a ceremonial chamber.

Geordi races against time, with the assistance of an holographic version of one of the ship's designers, to discover a way to escape the deadly trap.	Geordi La Forge enjoys a holodeck date with Christy Henshaw, but he gets rejected by her just after he calls up a holographic gypsy violin player to play Johannes Brahms - Hungarian Dance No. 5. Christy tells La Forge that, while she thinks he is a great person, she doesn't like him in that way. La Forge, dejected, yells at the violin player to knock it off. Meanwhile, Data and Wesley Crusher play three-dimensional chess in Ten Forward and remark on the asteroid remains at Orelious IX, visible from the lounge's large viewports. They discuss that neither side expected this site to be the final battle in their conflict; the destruction is impressive considering the primitive weapons used in the time period. Wesley sees La Forge enter Ten Forward and he realizes that his date didn't go so well since it ended earlier than expected. Just then, Commander Riker calls Data to the bridge. The USS Enterprise-D picks up a distress signal from the asteroid field and sets a course to approach. Captain Picard believes it to be an ancient interplanetary code, which Data confirms it is. Riker dismisses it as it is not possible there are survivors after all this time. When they arrive, they discover a ship in the field, which Lieutenant Worf immediately identifies it as a Promellian battle cruiser with a hint of delight. An awestruck Picard identifies the ship's fusion engines are still intact. Data says there are no life signs aboard the ship and the captain says there shouldn't be: it's a ship which belongs in a museum. He explains that they are 'a little late' and that the signal for help from the cruiser was probably sent over a thousand years ago. 	The Enterprise triggers an ancient yet effective trap left by an extinct race, with a perfectly preserved derelict ship serving as cheese for Picard.

The crew of the Enterprise struggles to keep the Romulan alive and to locate Geordi on the surface. Meanwhile, on the surface, as Geordi moves closer to the beacon the Enterprise left to guide him, he is taken prisoner by a second Romulan, Bokra. Geordi attempts to convince Bokra that they must work together to stay alive and be rescued while a Romulan Warbird closes in on the Enterprise determined to retrieve their lost comrades from the grip of the Federation.	An away team from the USS Enterprise-D consisting of Commander Riker, Lieutenant Commander La Forge and Lieutenant Worf beam down to Galorndon Core, a planet inside Federation territory near the Neutral Zone, to investigate the source of a distress call that has been intercepted. Surface conditions make this difficult. Powerful electromagnetic storms on the surface are obscuring all scans. Their combadges also do not function and tricorder scans are severely limited. A crashed vessel is found, bearing the markings of a Romulan vessel. As the group splits up to investigate the area, Worf locates a Romulan survivor, alive enough to feebly attack him. Worf incapacitates the Romulan and calls for Riker. Meanwhile, La Forge falls into a large chasm and is cut-off from the rest of the away team. As the transport window closes, Worf and Riker return to the beam-out site with the wounded Romulan and are forced to return without La Forge to avoid being stranded on the planet. Inside the chasm, La Forge futilely yells Worf and Riker's names out. 	La Forge gets left behind on a storm-plagued planet when the rest of his team encounters a Romulan warrior.

"Counselor Troi enters her quarters after what appears to be an exhausting day. She begins to read three letters from her mother, ignoring a research inquiry originating in Canada from the Manitoba Journal of Interplanetary Psychology and plans on having a ""real"" chocolate sundae from her replicator (which unfortunately cannot create it without very clear description) when she is called by Captain Picard to attend a reception in Ten Forward for delegates negotiating for the rights to the Barzan wormhole, which is about to appear visibly. After attempting to beg off, she reluctantly heads to Ten Forward, muttering sarcastically to herself about not wanting to miss seeing a wormhole. Once arriving, Picard introduces her to Premier Bhavani of Barzan II and two of the negotiators: Mendoza of the Federation and Leyor of the Caldonians. Then the third negotiator, Devinoni Ral, a Human representing the Chrysalians, introduces himself. Troi seems immediately drawn to Ral, who has an attractive female companion on his arm. Those gathered then turn their attention out the forward windows, where the Barzan wormhole – the only stable wormhole known to exist – makes itself visible, as it does every 233 minutes. Troi then turns to Ral, who is looking at her with interest, as Bhavani tells the competitors that the wormhole is theirs – for the right price.

Crusher sees blood on a sharp metal fragment, and while scanning it with her medical tricorder, notes it is not Human blood, and will have to do more tests on it when they get back to sickbay on the USS Enterprise-D. Data detects life signs behind a door, demonstrating his superior strength and pries the door open when Worf could not. Behind it, two Federation scientists lie, stunned and unmoving… 	"The Enterprise pursues a race of ""gatherers"" who continue to raid Federation outposts, unaware of the dangers lurking among them."

After the Enterprise easily chases off the Warbird, they beam aboard the occupant of the scoutship, Setal, who has information about a new Romulan offensive. The Enterprise crew, skeptical about the defector's claims and motives and attempting to get at the truth, travels to Nelvana 3 where there is supposed to be a Romulan base at which a large Romulan fleet will gather to launch an offensive against the Federation.	As Data performs in Shakespeare's play Henry V on the holodeck, Captain Picard watches while standing nearby and applauds him that he is getting better and better with his performance. Data intends to study the Human condition through Shakespeare. They are interrupted by Commander Riker, who informs them that sensors have detected an unidentified craft in the Romulan Neutral Zone headed towards Federation space. Picard and Data leave the holodeck and discuss why a king would want to pose as a commoner. Picard tells Data to listen to what Shakespeare was saying about the man, as the king wanted to share his men's fears before they went into battle. Data asks Picard when he can schedule a performance for the crew. Picard responds that they should not rush that right now. Picard arrives on the bridge, and Riker informs him that Outpost Sierra VI has confirmed that the vessel is a Romulan scout ship. The ship hails the USS Enterprise-D and its pilot requests assistance and asylum, as he is under pursuit. The ship enters visual range and Worf displays it on the main viewer, just as a Romulan warbird decloaks, chasing the scout ship. 	When a Romulan officer defects to the Federation with a warning of a impending invasion, Capt. Picard struggles to decide if he is to be believed.

While there, a prisoner escapes jail and Prime Minister Narok asks for assistance in recapturing him. The Enterprise succeeds in capturing him, only to find that he is extremely dangerous and not all that Narok has claimed him to be.	At the conclusion of the tour, Captain Picard and Commander Riker congratulate Nayrok on their culture's rapid recovery from the Tarsian War, and Nayrok says their people are equally grateful; violence of any kind is abhorrent to the Angosians, who consider art and intellectual achievement to be their greatest virtues. As they are talking, Nayrok's aide, Zayner, pulls him aside with an urgent matter. In private, Picard comments that the Angosians will make a fine addition to the Federation's members. Riker agrees, although he finds the people of Angosia III somewhat stuffy.  Nayrok returns and asks for Picard's help: an Angosian prisoner has escaped from a penal colony, Lunar V, in a stolen transport vessel. Angosian security forces are trying to track him down, but, frankly, are not very well-trained or equipped. With Picard's agreement, Riker signals the USS Enterprise-D with his combadge, where Data is currently in command. The ship's sensors locate the subwarp vessel with little difficulty, but as soon as they begin pursuit, the transport ship ducks behind a nearby asteroid and jettisons its drive section, which is devoid of life readings. When the Enterprise circles around the asteroid, they locate the wreckage of the ship's main body on the surface, but Wesley Crusher reports in surprise that the drive section has meanwhile disappeared. Slightly bewildered, Data reports to an astonished Picard and Riker that the tiny vessel has successfully eluded the Galaxy-class starship. 	Investigating a planet applying for membership into the Federation, the crew of the Enterprise finds a group of inhabitants who used to be soldiers, but now fight for their very existence.

The USS Enterprise-D is in orbit above the non-affiliated planet Rutia IV on a routine mission dropping off medical supplies. Lt. Commander Data, Lt. Worf, and Dr. Beverly Crusher are on the surface having lunch in a plaza in the city. When she calls for the waiter, a bomb explodes injuring several bystanders.  Crusher rushes over to help the wounded while Worf tries to provide security for her, knowing that their position is vulnerable. The doctor orders him to get medical supplies for the wounded. Data reminds her that the Rutians have physicians; she snaps back that none are there right now while she is. Worf and a waiter return with the improvised medical supplies. Data informs the ship about the attack, and Captain Picard orders the team to beam up, under protests from Crusher. Commander Riker suggests that if they do beam her up, he does not want to meet her on the pad when she materializes. Out of nowhere, an Ansata terrorist appears, killing a police officer before abducting Crusher, unchallenged by the two Starfleet officers remaining, or the three other officers. 	While visiting a planet under civil war, Dr. Crusher is taken hostage by an opposing faction of the planet's ruling government.

This time, Q, totally naked, claims he has been kicked out of the Q-Continuum and asks for sanctuary. Q is now mortal and wants guidance from the crew on how to be human, in exchange for his experience and knowledge. While on the Enterprise, Q is attacked by the Calamarians, a race that wants revenge on Q for acts done to them.	"The USS Enterprise-D is called to Bre'el IV to help them with their moon that is falling out of orbit and threatening the planet. As they explore ways of returning the moon into its orbit using the ship's tractor beam, a strange piercing sound is heard before Q suddenly tumbles from mid-air, completely naked, onto the deck of the bridge. ""Red alert,"" Q says while grinning at Captain Picard. "	Much to Picard's displeasure, Q reappears on the Enterprise, claiming to have been ejected from the Q Continuum, and therefore, lost his powers.

Chief Investigator Krag, arrives on board the Enterprise and demands Riker be turned over to him to face trial for murder. Picard, unwilling to release Riker without a hearing convinces the Chief Investigator to allow the circumstances of the incident be recreated on the holodeck with the help of statements from all parties concerned. Meanwhile, bursts of unknown radiation, able to cause damage to metal, plague the Enterprise.	"Captain Picard is attending figure drawing class with two other crewmembers, Ensign Williams and Lieutenant Wright, and all three are painting canvasses of an unknown figure – later revealed to be a nude model. Lieutenant Commander Data enters and informs the captain that the USS Enterprise has arrived at Tanuga IV, and that the away team has completed its survey of Dr. Nel Apgar's research and is ready to return to the ship. Picard acknowledges Data while he tries to subtly get a better look at the captain's painting. Picard notices and makes a gesture allowing Data to examine his work and that of the other students. Data compliments the work of Ensign Williams and Lieutenant Wright, but he is much more critical of Picard's work, saying that it is disorganized, using too many disparate techniques. Picard grimaces while Data makes his assessment but ""thanks"" him when he feels that Data has said enough, and the android leaves. Picard enters the bridge, welcoming Lieutenant Commander La Forge back from the station. The captain asks where Commander Riker is. La Forge replies that he is still on the station where Dr. Apgar is working as Apgar wanted to speak to Riker. Although La Forge replies evenly, Picard notices some tension in his speech, and asks if there were any problems. The chief engineer seems unsure of how to reply but says that nothing went wrong with the scientific portion of the mission. Picard becomes even more curious about what happened on the station due to La Forge's explanation, but La Forge is spared when Riker's exasperated voice is heard through the communicator asking to leave the station immediately. La Forge tells the captain that Riker will explain when he returns. Chief O'Brien engages the transporter to bring Riker back, but nothing happens, and when he reads the console, he immediately calls engineering, informing them of a power drain. Without warning, the station suddenly explodes, to the horror of Picard and the bridge crew seeing the event on the viewscreen. O'Brien has not beamed Riker back yet as he is having trouble clearing the first officer's signal, but eventually Riker is brought aboard. Riker asks why O'Brien is so surprised that he brought him back; O'Brien informs him that the science station just exploded. Riker turns to the transporter, with a visibly shocked look. "	The widow of respected scientist Dr. Nel Apgar accuses Riker of seducing her and killing her husband. Rather than turn Riker over for unfavorable trial, the Enterprise reconstructs the facts.

In this new reality, the Enterprise is at war with the Klingons, a war that they cannot win. Also, Tasha Yar is still alive and serving as Tactical Officer aboard the Enterprise-D. The Enterprise-C is critically damaged and was apparently involved in a fight with Romulans while in defense of a Klingon base. The crews eventually realize that, had the Enterprise-C been successful, the current war with the Klingons might never have happened. Clearly, the Enterprise-C must return even though it is likely to never survive the battle. When the Captain of the Enterprise-C is killed during a Klingon attack, Lt. Castillo asks to take the ship back through the warp himself. Meanwhile, Guinan, whose peculiar senses have told her that things are not as they should be, tells Tasha that in the true timeline, Tasha died an empty death. This convinces Tasha that she should return with the Enterprise-C as their tactical officer so that her death can have some meaning, and so she can be with Castillo with whom she has fallen in love.	"Worf is sitting alone in Ten Forward when Guinan comes over to his table and hands him a glass and asks him to try the drink. Worf tries it and is extremely surprised to find that he loves the drink. Guinan tells Worf it's an Earth drink, prune juice, which Worf refers to as ""a warrior's drink"" after taking a sip. Guinan notes that Worf always drinks alone and suggests that he seek out some companionship. However, Worf says he would need a Klingon woman for companionship as he considers Earth females to be too fragile. He then laughs loudly when Guinan tells him there are women aboard who might find him tame, a thought he considers impossible. When Guinan playfully calls him a coward for saying he'll never know when she says he should find out, Worf says he was merely concerned for the safety of his fellow crewmates. Just then, a strange phenomenon appears outside Ten Forward's windows and Worf is called to the bridge. Guinan stands up and looks toward the phenomenon and simply utters ""No."" Arriving on the bridge, Worf is told that the USS Enterprise-D has encountered what appears to be a strange temporal rift in space. Investigating, the crew are unable to confirm exactly what and precisely where the phenomenon is. Worf reports a change in sensor readings. Captain Picard turns his back on Worf and asks Data for more information, who begins to check the sensors. As a starship emerges from the rift, the bridge of the Enterprise changes. It now appears much darker and the crew's uniforms have more of a militaristic flair to them. No one present seems aware of the changes. Picard turns to the tactical station and asks if the ship that emerged is an enemy vessel. However Worf is gone, and Natasha Yar stands in his place. Troi has also disappeared. Down in a much more brightly lit Ten Forward, as Guinan clears a table, everyone is in uniform and all are armed. She straightens up and senses something isn't right, that everything has changed. As the starship clears the rift, Yar confirms it as a Federation starship and tries to access the ship's registry. Commander Riker notes the crew must have had a rough ride. Yar reads the ship's registry as NCC-1701-C, which causes Picard and Riker to turn toward her in astonishment as Yar finishes reading the name of the ship… USS Enterprise-C. "	The Enterprise C enters the Enterprise D's time and space continuum, where they find Picard and crew in a constant state of war with the Klingons, and only Guinan knows it.

However, the Romulans claim that space and are also sending ships to contact the newly discovered alien.  "	"As an initial step in the process surveying systems for Federation colonization, the USS Enterprise-D is on routine assignment preparing detailed exospheric charts of the Hayashi system, when the USS Hood is detected by Worf on long-range sensors rapidly approaching on an intercept course – a rather odd appearance as they weren't expecting a rendezvous. Captain Robert DeSoto of the Hood, a long-time friend of Captain Picard, as well as Commander Riker's former captain, hails the Enterprise on a secure channel. Both captains engage in small talk with DeSoto pointing out while the ""Galaxy-class boys"" explore the unknown, he just ""hauls"" himself back and forth between starbases, but not today. He informs them that Starfleet has new orders and they require the best ship and crew, which is the Enterprise. However, these new orders are time-critical, because of security concerns of Romulan subspace surveillance, the orders are being conveyed to the Enterprise via mission specialist Tam Elbrun. The fact that this new mission is being spearheaded by Tam Elbrun causes concern among many of the command personnel of the Enterprise, particularly Commander Riker due to Tam Elbrun's involvement in the Ghorusda Disaster, which had cost the lives of forty-seven Starfleet personnel, among them Captain Darson of the USS Adelphi and two of Riker's Academy classmates. Many people, including Riker, place the blame squarely on Tam Elbrun for this tragedy. Counselor Deanna Troi asks the captain if she may come with him and Data to greet Tam in a transporter room and discloses that she had previously known Tam Elbrun as a patient at the university on Betazed where she was studying psychology.

Meanwhile, strange malfunctions start occurring on the Enterprise.	"Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, a new and brilliant engineer, relaxes in Ten Forward when Counselor Troi enters. Guinan, tending bar, warns Barclay that she doesn't want trouble here. Barclay questions why there'd be trouble, and she answers that wherever Barclay goes, trouble seems to follow. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge enters and browbeats Barclay for being derelict; he's supposed to be on duty at this current moment. Barclay exhibits gross insubordination, tells La Forge to ""take himself and his holier-than-thou attitude and get out of his life"", and shoves La Forge so hard he sprawls against a booth near the starboard wall.  Commander Riker approaches from the other end of the bar, strangely not looking shocked or angered, and tells Barclay that what he has just done is insubordination, to which Barclay toasts after glancing at Troi. Riker makes a grab for him, but Barclay reverses and suddenly has Riker in a choke hold. Barclay tells Riker that he's nothing more than ""a pretty mannequin in a fancy uniform"", full of hot air. If Captain Picard has something to say to him, he should come and say it to Barclay himself. Barclay releases Riker hard, slamming him on the bar. As this happens, La Forge finally recovers from his sprawl and runs out of Ten Forward. Troi, watching these events, seems worried over what she senses from Barclay. Indeed, as Barclay joins her, she says that she senses his confidence and arrogant resolve, and that it excites her. They're just about to kiss, when suddenly an unknown officer's voice pipes up on the intercom, and tells Barclay to report to Cargo Bay 5, now. Barclay tells Troi that it (whatever they were going to do) will have to wait until later, and annoyed, tells the voice he'll be right there.  Then he stands near the entrance to Ten Forward, and says, ""Save program,"" and everything disappears, leaving the yellow hologrid of the holodeck. Barclay has been running a holodeck simulation of his delusions of grandeur, and his attitude as shown on his face indicates a far more timid, hesitant personality than the one he had put on display in the holographic Ten Forward. In Cargo Bay 5, the real La Forge and Riker are overseeing the beam-in of several containers on the cargo bay's transporter pad. La Forge tells Riker that he is basically at his wit's end when dealing with Barclay, that he is always late and never gives his best effort, and questions how someone like Barclay could have even made it through the Academy. Riker says he'll speak to the captain about ""Broccoli"", then explains that this is the nickname Wesley has given Barclay, and tells La Forge to keep it to himself; La Forge notes that the nickname is apt. Duffy, the officer working with the canisters has now placed them on an anti-grav sled, and informs La Forge that one of the canisters has a broken seal; indeed we see vapor pouring from the front middle canister. La Forge tells Duffy to destroy the broken canister, as the samples inside will be tainted. The cargo bay doors open and finally Barclay arrives. Upon spotting his two superiors he moves behind several red barrels to try to hide, but they've seen him, and La Forge asks him if it is a problem to report to duty on time. Barclay makes up some lame story about having received a communique that required his immediate attention, but La Forge doesn't want to hear it. He cools off, though, and tells Barclay about the anti-grav platform's difficulty. Barclay moves to follow his orders, but Riker grabs his arm, and tells him he's tired of seeing him disciplined by his superiors; he doesn't know how things were done on Barclay's last posting, but here on the Enterprise, there is a different standard set for the crew. Riker walks out, casting dark glances back towards Barclay. "	"A shy member of the ""Enterprise"" crew becomes addicted to the holodeck, where relationships are easier than in real life, when his knowledge is needed in engineering."

The seller is a trader named Kivas Fajo, his ship, the Jovis. Transport of the hytritium through the transporter is not advisable so Lt. Commander Data is making the trips via the shuttlepod Pike. As Data makes his last transport, a woman named Varria asks him to confirm the last transport with his fingerprint. Suddenly, Data is electrically shocked and disabled the moment he presses his thumb to the device. Varria then scans him to ascertain his components and a technician records the readings.

Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan is called aboard the USS Enterprise-D to fulfill his latest diplomatic duty, a treaty with a mysterious race known as the Legarans. Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Commander William T. Riker are in dress uniforms and walking down a corridor on their way to meet the ambassador. Picard explains to Riker how as a lieutenant, he became tongue-tied the first time he met Sarek briefly at his son's wedding. Riker then asks Picard if the rumors that Sarek will be retiring after these negotiations are true, and the captain confirms that it's unofficial but true, and the successful negotiations with the Legarans will be considered a perfect way to end such an exemplary career. They enter the transporter room and Sarek's aides, Ki Mendrossen and Sakkath, are beamed aboard. Mendrossen advises that Sarek is not a young man anymore and though Sarek may wish to attend the events that the Enterprise has prepared for him, he says that it is ill-advised because Sarek will tire too easily. He must be ready to negotiate with the Legarans when the Enterprise arrives at Legara IV. Picard says that they have readied a Mozart concert for him. Sarek and his wife, Perrin, are then beamed on board the Enterprise by Chief O'Brien. He introduces his wife, who, like his first wife, is Human.

She establishes a neural link between La Forge and the alien, to allow La Forge's brain to regulate both nervous systems and stabilize the alien until they can beam up to the Enterprise. Crusher advises La Forge to breathe normally and that she will terminate the link between them if anything goes wrong. When the connection is made, an energy discharge enters La Forge's mind, and he inhales sharply, but assures Crusher that he's fine. As soon as the alien stabilizes, all three of them are beamed directly to sickbay. 	The Enterprise finds a deserted planet where a ship has crashed, and, with it, the lone survivor with no memory, but extraordinary healing powers.

They discover that the entire town has been removed and only a crater remains. Fearing that this might be the first step in the invasion by the Borg, the Enterprise takes on board Lt. Commander Shelby who has become the Federation's tactical expert on the Borg. She makes it plain to many that she is highly interested in replacing Riker, who has, again, been offered his own command. Admiral Hanson attempts to convince Picard that Riker should take the new command for the good of his career. After investigating the evidence, they come to the conclusion that it was the Borg that destroyed the colony. Now, the Federation has to develop weapons and defenses against the cyborg aliens. While Shelby and the Enterprise crew struggle with the problem, they learn that a Federation ship sent out a distress call describing an encounter with the Borg. The Enterprise, being the nearest ship, travels to the scene and meet the Borg. The Borg hail Picard specifically and demand that Picard beam aboard their ship immediately, threatening the destruction of the Enterprise if he refuses. Picard, naturally, refuses. After a brief, but losing battle with the Borg, the Enterprise, to escape, enters a nebula with the Borg ship in pursuit. Once in the nebula, they drop to impulse and begin repairs to the ship. They also analyze the recent battle and discover that the Borg are vulnerable to phasers in one particular frequency band. The Borg ship starts mining the nebula and forces the Enterprise out. Once out of the nebula, several Borg beam over to the Enterprise and grab Picard. The Borg then head for Earth. The Enterprise crew must devise a plan to cripple the Borg ship and retrieve Picard. This episode is the finale of the third season and is a cliffhanger episode to be continued in the fourth season.	Commander Riker, Data, Worf, and Geordi La Forge file into a transporter room. Worf notifies Riker that there has been no contact from the surface of Jouret IV for over twelve hours, nor are there any signs of life on the surface. Immediately after the away team is beamed down by Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, the team finds not only that the entire colony of New Providence has been completely destroyed but also that the colony's former town center is now nothing more than a giant crater. 	Responding to a distress call on one of the Federation's outer-most colonies, the Enterprise arrives...only to find a big hole in the ground where the town used to be, and discovers the Borg are behind the attack.

The Borg are heading for Earth with Captain Picard on board and the Federation is arming for a final battle. The Enterprise, now commanded by Riker pursues the Borg toward Earth.	"Geordi La Forge reports that the main deflector dish is six seconds away from discharging. Hope and concern are on the face of the entire bridge crew as they look at what the Borg have done to Captain Picard on the viewscreen. The USS Enterprise opens fire with its deflector dish-weapon which impacts the Borg ship… and causes no damage. Shelby is incredulous as Riker realizes the futility of their resistance and orders La Forge to cease fire before the warp core overloads. Riker laments aloud that the Borg couldn't possibly have adapted that quickly but Locutus states that the knowledge and experience of Picard has been added to the Borg's collective consciousness and that they are now prepared for all possible courses of action that the Enterprise and the Federation are preparing to take. Locutus then notes that their resistance is hopeless, while chillingly addressing Riker as ""Number One."" "	Having absorbed Captain Picard and his knowledge, the Borg head for Earth, leaving Riker and the Enterprise desperate for an unanticipated way to defeat them.
74	74	74	74	178	Family	4	2	1990-09-29 0:00:00	FAMILY	Family	In this episode, several of the crew are faced with family related matters and relatives. Picard, having been rescued from the Borg returns to his home town to visit with his brother and his family. Worf is visited on the Enterprise by his adoptive parents - the Roszhenkos. And Wesley must decide whether to view a hologram tape made by his late father.	With the USS Enterprise-D undergoing repairs in drydock following the Borg attack, many members of the crew are either taking shore leave or are having family aboard. Commander Riker tells Worf in the Enterprise's observation lounge that his foster parents, Sergey and Helena Rozhenko, are on the visitors list. Worf is not happy to hear this news. He tells Riker it's inappropriate for a Klingon to receive family while on duty. But since the Enterprise isn't a Klingon ship, there's not a lot he can do to stop it. Riker tells him if he doesn't want to see his parents, it's his business but reminds Worf that it's not often they get back to Earth. Worf turns down an offer from Riker to have more off-duty time. As Worf starts to leave, Riker asks if he's afraid they might find out about what had happened on the Klingon homeworld and Worf tells Riker that he's already written them and told them of his discommendation, adding that he doesn't believe any Human can truly understand his dishonor. Meanwhile, Captain Picard, himself undergoing repairs of the emotional kind following his assimilation, is packing to go to Earth. He is visited by Counselor Troi, who asks him where he's going. He tells her he is going to go to La Barre, France, his home village. It will be the first time he has gone home in nearly twenty years. Troi says she finds it interesting that Picard is going on vacation so easily and yet they could hardly pry him out of his command chair for a vacation for the last three years they have served together. Picard tells her simply that it's Earth, it's home, and he doesn't think he needs a much better reason. He tells Troi that her assistance has been invaluable to him, but that he's much better now, saying his nightmares have ended and that what he needs now is some time to himself. Troi agrees, but states that his destination could stand some scrutiny. Picard tells her that if she wants to think that his going home is a result of being assimilated, she should feel free. Troi reminds him that it's just going to take time. His assimilation was an extremely traumatic event, and he won't recover quickly, and that it's perfectly natural to spend time trying to find oneself again. Picard responds that there is no better way to find himself but on the streets of his home village. She then tells Picard she hopes he has a safe trip, kisses him on the cheek, and leaves him. Picard reaches for a few books, then decides against taking them, putting them back on the shelf, and then heads out of his quarters. 	After defeating the Borg, the crew of the Enterprise experiences shore leave in various ways. Captain Picard's return to his family's vineyard in France has some extraordinary repercussions.

After he runs off, he eats a poisonous fruit and the Enterprise must get him to a Starbase for treatment. Meanwhile, Data seemingly malfunctions and takes over the Enterprise, changing its heading to an unknown location. Once there Data beams down to the surface to be reunited with his creator, Dr. Nonnian Soong and with his brother, Lore. Brent Spiner reprises his role as Lore, and plays Noonan Soong.	Dr. Crusher is involved in a medical emergency as Willie Potts, a young child of the USS Enterprise-D, is infected by parasites from a cove palm that he ate during shore leave on Ogus II with his brother Jake. Willie ate the parasitic fruit while upset from a practical joke in which Jake pretended Willie had killed him with a toy laser pistol by stuffing a balloon with red pillion dye into his vest. With his health rapidly declining, Willie has to be quarantined to protect the rest of the crew and to be stabilized before he can be transferred to Starbase 416 for immediate medical attention. In the observation lounge, the older Potts recounts the incident to Commander Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi, explaining that he frightened Willie for amusement, but that he did not intend serious harm to come to his brother. En route to sickbay in the turbolift with Jake Potts, Lieutenant Commander Data begins to reassure Jake when he uncharacteristically stops in the middle of his sentence and redirects the turbolift to the bridge while no longer even acknowledging the boy's presence. Jake clings to the turbolift wall out of sight and lets the door close, unsure of what to do. 	After an accident aboard the Enterprise leaves one of its children in grave danger, Data commandeers the Enterprise, driven to take the ship to an unknown origin, where an interesting figure awaits.

The child, Jono, turns out to be the last remaining survivor from a colony presumed destroyed by the Talarians. Picard must decide whether to return the boy to his Talarian father who raised him and is suspected of abusing him or to his natural grandmother, an admiral in Starfleet. Meanwhile, Jono attempts to learn human habits and customs after his many years with the Talarians.	As the USS Enterprise-D approaches the Talarian craft, Worf informs Captain Picard that there is no response from the vessel and Picard orders that an open channel be maintained. Doctor Crusher and her medical team are standing by to beam onboard the Talarian vessel. However, Data provides a warning by noting that this may be a well-known Talarian tactic as evidenced during the Talarian war. The Talarians would abandon their vessels, rig them to self-destruct, and send out a distress call. Troi senses life on board, which is rapidly fading. Despite Data's warning, Picard decides to send the away team over to the craft. When Worf, Riker, Crusher, Martinez, and other medics board the ship, they discover five Talarian males, all wearing uniforms, who are unconscious with radiation burns. They conclude it is a training ship and beam them all to sickbay, but not before Doctor Crusher finds one of the boys is Human. 	On a rescue mission to an alien shipwrecked training mission, they discover one of its trainees to be a human.
77	77	77	77	179	Remember Me	4	5	1990-10-20 0:00:00	REMEMBER ME	Remember Me	Wesley and Geordi are involved with an experiment in engineering as the Enterprise takes on new crew members at Starbase 133. Dr. Crusher welcomes on board an old friend, Dr. Quaice who seemingly disappears overnight without a trace. In fact, no one, including O'Brien who beamed him up, remembers seeing him and there is no trace of his existence anywhere in Starfleet. As the crew begins to vanish, also without a trace, Dr. Crusher struggles to convince Picard that something is wrong and comes to doubt her own sanity.	"When Dr. Quaice, an elderly man, is beamed aboard by Chief O'Brien, he and Dr. Crusher begin talking about his life while they walk through corridors on the way to his quarters. Dr. Quaice's wife has died recently, so he is giving up his post in Starfleet and retiring. He tells Dr. Crusher that the worst part of growing old is that all of one's friends, all the people from one's life are gone, and that one never takes the time to appreciate them in their lifetime. Dr. Crusher agrees, telling him that even though she and her late husband, Jack R. Crusher, only had a few years together, she feels the same way. She continues contemplating what Dr. Quaice said. Meanwhile, in engineering, an eager Ensign Wesley Crusher performs an experiment with the ship's warp engines, while Chief engineer Geordi La Forge impatiently demands that ""his"" engines be put back online. Dr. Crusher enters engineering and comes to see Wesley, standing right before the warp core. Suddenly, due to Wesley's experiment failing, a short flash is emitted from the warp core. Wesley returns the engines to normal control, but when he looks up to talk to his mother, she is gone. Wesley thinks that she simply just walked away. The USS Enterprise-D leaves Starbase 133 as scheduled. When Dr. Crusher walks by to Dr. Quaice's quarters to visit him for breakfast, the room is empty and unused. When she asks the computer about Dr. Quaice's location, it claims that no one named Dalen Quaice is aboard the ship. "	Dr. Crusher's fear of losing loved ones becomes real when her worries create an alternate reality.

On Turkana Four, the crew of the Enterprise has their mission hampered by two warring factions. Lashara Yar is Tasha Yar's sister and attempts to help the Enterprise.	Riker, Data, Troi, and Worf are playing poker. Troi and Worf are not having much luck, as most of the chips are shared between the two commanding officers. Data raises the stakes, and makes Riker leave the hand. Noticing that they are comparable in poker skill, Riker offers to challenge Data with a magic trick, betting all his chips into a pot that he will retrieve any card Data will pick – with Data's help. Troi cautions Data from doing this and although he values her advice, the android accepts and adds all his chips with Riker's as Riker barely keeps from laughing out loud, believing he'll have an easy win. As instructed by Riker, Data pick a card (the Jack of Hearts) and puts it back in the deck without showing him. After shuffling and manipulating the cards several times, Riker makes Data pick the same Jack again, to Troi's surprise. Data is however hardly impressed, explaining that he saw that Riker had kept the edge of his left thumb on the card and shuffled so it was on top. By keeping track of it, he was able to have Data remove or keep cards at his choosing until Data's card was the only one left. His gamble having utterly failed, Riker is left chagrined as the triumphant Data rakes in all the chips for himself. In that moment, Captain Picard calls and informs them that the USS Enterprise-D has received a distress call. On the bridge, an audio message is received from the Arcos engineer Tan Tsu, explaining that a warp drive breach is to go critical in just five minutes. The sound of an explosion makes Tan Tsu inform the crew that it is now three minutes to core breach and thanks the Enterprise for trying to rescue them. Picard orders Ensign Bennett to increase the Enterprise's speed to warp 9.6, although the engines have already exceeded recommended limits. They arrive in transporter range just a second too late, witnessing the freighter explosion. However, Data has detected an escape pod trail, which is leading to the colony. The colony is infamous for being lawless: the USS Potemkin was the last Federation ship to contact the outpost in 2361 and was warned that any intruder entering the colony would be killed. Despite this, Picard orders Riker to assemble an away team. 	The crew of the Enterprise enters into orbit around the home planet of their former crewmate, Tasha Yar, where they encounter her sister.

Meanwhile, Worf has a reunion with his former mate, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, and their son.	"While investigating a radiation anomaly in the Gamma Arigulon system, the USS Enterprise-D is approached by a Klingon Vor'cha-class starship. When Picard hails the ship, he is pleased to be answered by Ambassador K'Ehleyr. Worf acknowledges her with a curt nod of his head when she greets him. She asks to come aboard to talk about an ""urgent matter"". Picard assigns Worf to greet her, who does so even though he is reluctant due to his discommendation with the Klingon Empire. Worf explains his reluctance to Picard, who sternly tells him that he is a member of the Enterprise crew and he will not go into hiding whenever a Klingon vessel decloaks. In the transporter room, Worf is surprised to learn from transporter chief Hubbell that two will be beamed aboard. He is further surprised when he sees the second person beaming on board with K'Ehleyr: a Klingon child with Worf's cranial ridges. Worf immediately realizes that the young boy must be his son. "	When the leader of the Klingon High Council dies, Picard finds himself in the middle of the struggle for the now-vacant position. Meanwhile, Worf reunites with a past love, only to find he now has a son.

Riker commands an away team to the planet but, the team succumbs to gas. Riker wakes in sickbay to discover that it is 16 years later and he is now the captain of the Enterprise in the middle of tricky negotiations with the Romulans. He also apparently has a son named Jean-Luc. Riker struggles to regain his memory and continue his mission but, something doesn't seem right.	"Commander Riker is having his birthday party in Ten Forward. In front of everyone, he plays the trombone and fails to hit a high note. Everyone laughs as he wishes for music lessons when blowing out the candles on his cake. Captain Picard and Lieutenant commander Data are leaving to join the party on the bridge when Ensign Gleason detects some unusual subspace frequencies. The source is determined to be coming from the M-Class but uninhabited planet Alpha Onias III near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Picard mentions a rumor about a secret Romulan base in the sector, and sends Riker to lead an away team and investigate whether the Romulans are involved. Riker, Worf and La Forge beam down to the surface. The mission is aborted after the surface unexpectedly fills with methane gas. The away team falls unconscious and transporter chief Hubbell tries to have them beamed up but informs Picard that there is too much interference to obtain a positive lock.  Riker awakens in sickbay to nurse Alyssa Ogawa. Doctor Beverly Crusher comes over, happy that Riker remembers her and asks him what else he remembers, calling him ""captain."" In the mirror, Riker sees himself aged. "	Riker awakens sixteen years after an away mission where he contracted a disease which destroyed his memory back to the point of infection - or so he's told.

On the way to the planet, the shuttle craft piloted by one of the miners is forced to make a crash landing on the moon of Pentares 3. Meanwhile, Riker, in command of the Enterprise, leads the ship in a rescue mission to save a planet from the harmful effects of radiation from an errant abandoned ship.	Ensign Wesley Crusher comes running onto the bridge and apologizes to Captain Picard for being ten minutes late. Picard chastises the young man, then, smiling, informs the young ensign that a position has opened in this year's class at Starfleet Academy and that Wesley has been granted the posting. Admiral Nsomeka has contacted Picard and expects Wesley to be leaving for the Academy in two weeks, though he will have to work hard to catch up with his classmates. Picard has assured the admiral that Wesley is fully capable of doing so and jokingly hopes that he will not make a liar out of him. Wesley promises that he will not. In the interim, Picard is to arbitrate a mining dispute on Pentarus V between hostile salenite miners, and he opts to bring Wesley along to observe the effects of outpost judiciary decisions on Federation law. The USS Enterprise-D rendezvouses with Captain Dirgo's shuttle, the Nenebek, and Picard and Wesley depart with Dirgo. On first meeting Dirgo, Wesley quietly makes a rude comment to Geordi La Forge on Dirgo calling himself a captain – though he holds no formal rank and commands only a mere mining shuttle. Dirgo makes it clear he heard it and says the ship has over ten-thousand hours of flight recorded and means a lot to him and his people. Shortly before their departure, the Enterprise receives a distress signal from Chairman Songi of Gamelan V – an unidentified space barge has entered into orbit above Gamelan V and has caused the radiation levels in the planet's atmosphere to increase by 3,000%. Songi is unsure if the planet is under attack by some hostile force aboard the barge, but the ship has not been answering their hails. The Enterprise speeds off at warp 6 under Riker's command to assist.  Meanwhile, Dirgo tells Wesley that he hopes Picard is tougher than he looks, otherwise the miners will tear him apart. Just then, Dirgo's shuttle suffers a mishap, and is likely going to crash land. 	Before leaving for Starfleet Academy, Wesley Crusher accompanies Captain Picard on a dangerous mission.

None of the Enterprise's engines or weapons can be used to free the Enterprise before the ship is dragged by the entity into a cosmic string. Meanwhile, Troi discovers that she is empathically blind and resigns as ship's counselor because she feels she is unable to perform her duties.	"The USS Enterprise-D is heading to T'lli Beta and won't arrive for several days. On the bridge, Lieutenant Worf temporarily sees strange readings. After being unable to pinpoint the source of the strange patterns (initially thought to be sensor ""ghosts""), Data suddenly detects an aggregate field of plane-polarized objects, but the reading also disappears. Captain Picard orders a full stop to confirm the readings. Meanwhile, Counselor Deanna Troi is conducting a session in her office with Ensign Janet Brooks, who recently lost her husband Marc and has buried herself in work to avoid grieving. Troi reminds Ensign Brooks that her husband would have had his 38th birthday today. Brooks remarks that Troi keeps excellent records. The other night, she admits she dreamed that she was celebrating with him. She then woke up and knew he was dead, for the first time, she realized. Brooks tried looking around for anything that belonged to her husband and forgot that after his funeral, she asked that his belongings be taken away. She wonders what she was thinking when she did this. Troi walks over to a cabinet and takes out a music box belonging to Marc Brooks. Ensign Brooks tearfully asks how Troi could have known and starts to cry into the counselor's shoulder while Troi holds her. As Troi sees Brooks out of her office, however, Troi comes under an intense pain. Stumbling about in her office, it becomes increasingly painful, and she loses consciousness.

On this particular day, Data describes his role in the wedding of Kako to O'Brien and the duties involved in escorting the Vulcan Ambassador T'Pel. T'Pel is on a diplomatic mission to open ties with the Romulans and orders Picard to enter the Neutral Zone to rendezvous with a Romulan warbird commanded by Admiral Mendak.	"Responding to Commander Maddox's help after Data's trial regarding his rights, Data records this log entry on Soong-type androids to aid Maddox's research. This is the day he records. It begins with the handover of the bridge from night watch to day watch, with Data ceding command to Commander Riker. The first officer has deliberately arrived 15 minutes early to give Data, a member of the O'Brien wedding party, more time to prepare – a courtesy the second officer appreciates. Data relates his not-quite-emotional anticipation regarding his participation in the wedding and gives Riker the updates from the night watch, which essentially sum up the action to come. Lieutenant Juarez has gone into labor, and the ship is stationed, awaiting the arrival of an Ambassador-class ship, the USS Zhukov, bearing Vulcan Ambassador T'Pel.  Data's narration continues as he departs the bridge and travels to his first off-watch destination: He then drops in on Keiko Ishikawa in her quarters to inform her that the wedding rehearsal is about to begin. Keiko, evidently anxious, reveals to Data that she is unhappy and that she would like to call off her wedding to Miles O'Brien. Upon Data questioning her, she says this decision would make her happy. Since Data introduced O'Brien to her, she also says it would mean a lot to her if he would talk to O'Brien on her behalf. Data accepts her request and leaves. Data arrives at Ten Forward, just as crew members are busily setting up the wedding decorations, and delivers Keiko's ""good news"" to O'Brien, whose reaction is entirely opposite Data's prediction. After O'Brien storms out of Ten Forward to see Keiko, Geordi La Forge advises that, next time, Data should let him deliver any ""good news."" When La Forge leaves, Data continues his narration:  "	Data tries to comprehend the complex emotions between O'Brien and Keiko, who are about to be married.

Captain Picard must intercept the Phoenix, commanded by Maxwell and put an end to his attacks on Cardassian ships. Meanwhile, Chief O'Brien must deal with his feelings for the Cardassians and his loyalties to Maxwell, Picard and the Federation.	"The USS Enterprise-D is conducting mapping surveys near the Cardassian border. Captain Picard is cautious. The Federation had been at war with Cardassia for some years and only recently has established a peace treaty between the two peoples in the past year. This particular sector is a second trip for Picard, as he once encountered the Cardassians in the sector when he was in command of the USS Stargazer. He tells the story to the bridge crew, recounting how he lowered his shields as a sign of good will, but the Cardassians took offense and attacked, taking out his weapons and damaging the impulse engines before he could regroup and run. Counselor Troi finds the story humorous, and expresses mock disbelief that Picard was capable of running away from a fight. Picard simply replies ""Believe it."" Lieutenant Worf says that the Cardassians have no sense of honor and should not be trusted. Troi replies that they are now allies and have to be trusted. Worf scoffs that trust is earned and not given. Even still, Picard does not want to stay too long near the border without letting the Cardassians know their intentions. Alone in their quarters, newly married Miles and Keiko O'Brien are having breakfast together. The chief doesn't seem to care much for Keiko's breakfast selections: kelp buds, plankton loaf, and sea berries, but she explains that she has this every morning and that it's very healthy. O'Brien diplomatically thanks her for introducing him to the food she's accustomed to and says that he'd love to make her food he's used to. He goes on to describe how his mother used to cook, using real, non-replicated food, as she believed that real food was more nutritious. This surprises Keiko, to which she incredulously asks if O'Brien's mother handled raw meat, touched it, and cut it. O'Brien says that he'll have to use the replicator to make something special for her, much to Keiko's delight. Their romantic moment is soon interrupted by a weapon impact, and the sounds of the red alert klaxon. O'Brien quickly gets up and reports to his station. Worf calls out that the Cardassian ship is beginning to fire again. The ship takes a hit off the shields and minor damage is sustained on the secondary hull before the shields went up. Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander La Forge calls out that the starboard power coupling is down, as the ship is hit by an even heavier blast. The fish-like Cardassian ship lets loose another salvo at the Enterprise; Picard initiates a delta-sequence maneuver and orders the ship's phasers ready and limits the targets to engines and shields. After scoring multiple hits on his opponent, Picard successfully forces his attacker to stand down. The Cardassian ship's captain, Gul Macet, answers the hail, and informs Picard that the attack on the Enterprise was in retaliation – a Federation starship attacked and destroyed an unarmed science station in the Cuellar system. Picard doesn't understand this and asks for one hour to speak with his superiors at Starfleet. The alternative is for each ship to continue firing at each other, which Picard reminds Gul Macet that such a contest would certainly put him at a disadvantage. Macet grants the Starfleet captain his request – only one hour. "	After being fired upon by a Cardassian vessel, Picard races against time to find out the facts behind the Cardassian commander's claim that the Federation attacked one of their outposts.

The Ventaxians appeal to the Enterprise for help and it becomes Captain Picard's responsibility to prove that Ardra is a fraud, the contract made 1000 years ago is invalid and that her diabolical powers are nothing more than a trick.	"On the holodeck, Jean-Luc Picard is sitting off to the side in a chair and is watching with interest as Data performs a scene from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, playing Ebenezer Scrooge to a holographic Jacob Marley. As with a previous critique of Data's performance as Henry V, (TNG: ""The Defector"") Picard compliments him on his technique, but encourages him to be more creative and less imitative. Data explains that he is using the technique of method acting, as it requires an actor to seek his or her emotional awareness to understand the character they are playing. Data believes that if he can learn to duplicate the fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, it will bring him one step closer to understanding Humanity. Picard remarks that Data's creation of his own interpretation of the role instead of duplicating other actors' performances has brought him closer to understanding Humanity. The USS Enterprise-D receives a distress call from a Federation science station on Ventax II. Commander Riker calls Picard to the bridge. They receive a garbled transmission from the team leader, Doctor Howard Clark, who reports that the planet is in chaos, and its entire population in the grip of mass hysteria: all of them believe their world is coming to an end. Suddenly, the transmission ends. "	While answering a distress call, Picard finds himself not sure of exactly who he is dealing with, but he's sure he's not dealing with the planet's version of the Devil, as she claims to be.

Evidence begins to mount that they were out for hours and that Data is, inexplicably, lying about what happened while they were unconscious.	After completing a mission early at Harrakis V, the crew of the USS Enterprise is granted extra personal time to pursue their interests, with Worf instructing a mok'bara class and Dr. Crusher conducting an experiment with Diomedian scarlet moss. Captain Jean-Luc Picard decides to show Guinan his Dixon Hill holodeck program. After a gangster character named Johnny is killed by gunfire outside the windows in Dixon Hill's office while holding up Picard and Guinan at gunpoint, Picard attempts to explain to her why Humans find mysteries so fascinating. Just then, Data informs him of the discovery of a T-Tauri type star near the Ngame Nebula. The sensors have detected that the system has one M-class planet, and a small, unstable wormhole, which disappears. Data notes such phenomena are not uncommon in T-Tauri systems – thirty-nine had been observed since 2267. Suddenly the wormhole reappears, and flings the vessel 0.54 parsecs from the system, and causes the entire crew, with the exception of Lieutenant Commander Data, to fall unconscious. 	Effects of passing through a wormhole give the Enterprise crew a sense that they were unconscious for more than the thirty seconds they've been led to believe.

Barclay who in HOLLOW PURSUITS was seen to be an introspective, shy crewman with difficulties in dealing with reality. A brief encounter with an alien device turns Barclay into a near-superbeing with confidence in his own superiority and a low regard for his fellow crewman. In the holodeck, Barclay builds a device which enables him to interface with the computer to take control of the Enterprise and hijacking it to an unknown and uncharted part of space.	"Reg Barclay and Dr. Crusher perform a scene from Cyrano de Bergerac in the theater room before a handful of the crew, including the senior officers. Crusher's performance is great as Cyrano's love interest but who is a woman already in love with another man, Cyrano's compatriot. But Barclay's performance, as Cyrano himself, complete with long prosthetic nose, is awkward, halting, and somewhat embarrassing to watch. Despite this rather lackluster performance, the crew present claps for both Crusher and Barclay, which puzzles Data until Riker explains that ""it's polite."" Afterwards, Troi compliments Barclay, saying it takes a lot of confidence to put himself out there and act, but Barclay doesn't feel too confident, awkwardly remaining on the play's set after everyone else has left. The USS Enterprise-D arrives at the Argus Array, a gigantic subspace telescope where the computer has failed and the reactors are going critical. A huge amount of time is estimated for its repair, but of more pressing concern is the mysterious alien probe now holding station near the array, determined to be the cause of its malfunctions. Geordi La Forge is assigned to examine the probe using a shuttle, and he decides to take Barclay along to help. As the two conduct some unsuccessful scans, Barclay thanks La Forge for selecting him for the mission. La Forge assures Reg that he's one of his best engineers and deserves to get to the ""interesting stuff"" sometimes. La Forge points at the probe just outside the shuttle's viewport and tells Barclay that this is why he is in Starfleet. Suddenly the probe emits a super-bright flash that knocks Barclay unconscious.

The Admiral, well known for resolving difficult disputes and brilliantly leading investigations arrives on the Enterprise with her entourage and proceeds to investigate the alleged treason. In the course of her investigations she turns up the fact that a crewman, Simon Tarsis, lied on his Acadamey application form. He originally claimed he was a Human/Vulcan hybrid but is actually a Human/Romulan mix. Satie attempts to prove that Tarsis is the person mainly responsible for leaking secrets to the Romulans on a regular basis.

The Enterprise determines that the weapons being supplied to the rebels, while appearing to be Federation issue are, in fact, manufactured by the Romulans.  While at Krios, La Forge returns to the Enterprise completely unaware that he has been with the Romulans and believing to have spent the time at Risa as planned.

Picard, as the chosen arbiter of succession must continue to fulfill his duty to see that Gowron becomes the emperor and that ties with the Federation continue. Meanwhile, Worf speaks to Gowron requesting that Worf's family honor be restored since it was Duras' family who betrayed the Kitomer outpost to the Klingons. Gowron refuses because of the influence that Duras' family still has with the council.  Picard beams down to the planet to perform his final act as arbiter. However, before he can properly install Gowron as the new emperor, Duras' sisters Lursa and B'Etor produce Toral, a bastard child of Gowron, who claims the right to succession. The ceremony is halted until Picard may decide if the child has a legitimate claim.  Worf, seeing the growing problems within the Klingon empire and the possibility of a civil war if Gowron becomes emperor, talks with his brother Kurn who is allied against Gowron. Worf convinces Kurn to lend his support to Gowron's forces so that the support may be used as a bargaining edge to regain the family honor.  Picard decides that Toral is not eligible to become emperor and bestows that title on Gowron. This causes the council to split with some following Gowron and some following Toral who is not only backed by the council and those loyal to the family of Duras but by Romulans led by a mysterious commander.  The Klingon empire is now at war. Worf, his family honor restored, resigns his commission as a Starfleet Officer to aide Gowron and learn what it means to be a Klingon. Meanwhile, the Romulans and the family of Duras make plans that will drag the Federation into the war and to lure Picard to his death.  This cliffhanger episode is the finale of the fourth season and will be concluded in the first episode of the new season. The actor portraying the mysterious Romulan commander is never given any credit in this episode or in THE MIND'S EYE where she first appeared however, it is clearly Denise Crosby. Hopefully, in the conclusion next season, we will discover the true identity of the commander, what her motives are and what caused her hatred for Picard.	Captain Picard takes the USS Enterprise-D to Qo'noS so that he may fulfill his role as the Klingon Arbiter of Succession. En route, he advises Worf during a visit to his quarters to take this opportunity to clear his father's name and regain his family honor. At first Worf feels that it is not yet time, but Picard reminds him that while patience is a Human virtue, this situation demands a more Klingon response. Worf does admit to Picard that he's getting tired of bearing the dishonor. Just then, the Enterprise is unexpectedly contacted by the Klingon vessel IKS Bortas, which is a surprise since no escort was scheduled. It's Gowron, who tells Picard that they will have to move quickly if they are to be successful in preventing a Klingon civil war. 	Both Captain Picard and Lt. Worf must decide where their priorities lie as the Klingon Empire descends into a bitter civil war.

The war between Duras' family and Gowron's heats up and Duras appears to be winning. They have had the help of the Romulans commanded by Sela. The Federation wishes to stay out of the fight since it is an internal civil war but Picard convinces the Fleet Admiral that the Romulans may be involved and therefore the Federation should be as well. Picard sets up a blockade to prevent Romulan ships from sending supplies to Duras' forces and eventually, Duras' forces are defeated by Gowrons.  Sela, in one of the strangest (but predictable) twists on the show, claims to be Tasha Yar's daughter. Since Tasha died childless in ""Skin of Evil"", it seems impossible for her to have a grown up daughter much less one in a position of command in the Romulan Empire. For the answer, one needs to look at the events in ""Yesterday's Enterprise"". In that episode, the Enterprise D encountered Enterprise C in an alternate history where Tasha was still alive on the D. At the end of the episode, she returns to the past on the Enterprise C. When the Enterprise D returns to its correct history line, all memories of the encounter vanish and Tasha's existence on the C was forgotten. However, Tasha was captured by the Romulans when she returned to the past on the Enterprise C and eventually married a Romulan General and had a child by him. Tasha was eventually executed for trying to escape the Empire and Sela, Tasha's daughter, now has a hatred for Picard since he sent Tasha back on the Enterprise C. If the writers of the show develop this further, things could get very interesting - I hope they do.  "	Kurn's ship, the Hegh'ta, with Worf now aboard as tactical officer, is narrowly escaping destruction by two other Birds-of-Prey near a sun. Most of the bridge crew lie dead, and the Hegh'ta is losing shield strength fast. With no weapons left to fight, Kurn instead uses a clever technique of engaging warp drive near a star's surface, causing a large solar flare which destroys the two pursuers. Meanwhile, Captain Picard meets with several senior Starfleet flag officers, including Fleet Admiral Shanthi, to discuss the Klingon civil war at Starbase 234. In the Enterprise-D's observation lounge, Picard briefs the admirals on three engagements occurring in the past two weeks that were won by ships loyal to the Duras family. Shanthi reminds Picard that none of those facts are the Federation's concern because the Klingon civil war is by definition an internal matter of the Empire. Picard says that would be true if the civil war were entirely internal, but if the Duras family is being aided by the Romulan Empire, then it very much becomes a concern for the Federation. Picard points out that the Romulans have been trying to destroy the Klingon-Federation Alliance for the last 20 years and the Duras family has been secretly conspiring with them at the same time. Picard asks her if it seems strange that the Duras are able to overpower and outmatch Gowron's forces at almost every turn. Shanthi speculates that the Duras family may have better leadership, but Picard states it's also possible that they're getting help. Picard reminds the admiralty that the Romulans are willing to take huge risks to gain any advantage they can over the Federation and now, with the future of the Klingon Empire in the balance, can the Federation seriously believe that the Romulans are content to just stand by and watch it unfold? Convinced of his argument, Shanthi asks Picard what he is proposing. The captain says that they must stop the flow of supplies and equipment from the Romulans to the Duras family. He proposes to the admiral that they send a fleet to the Klingon-Romulan border, engaging in no offensive action, but to create a blockade to intercept any Romulan supplies that attempt to cross the border. When Admiral Shanthi asks how they'll be able to overcome the problem of detecting ships equipped with cloaking devices, Picard answers that his chief engineer has developed a way that will counter their cloaking advantage: the tachyon detection grid. He explains to her that each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to each other; the theory is that any cloaked vessel that passes through it will be detected. Shanthi tells Picard that she'll have to clear it with the Federation Council first, but in the meantime, he is to go ahead and assemble his fleet. Commander Riker smiles at his captain, but also wonders if Picard knows what he's doing – a feeling the captain shares himself. 	As Worf fights in the Klingon Civil War, Captain Picard and his crew must stop the Romulans from helping their pawns achieve victory.

Solarian 4, a Federation outpost in a nearby star system was attacked by a ship claiming to be a Bajoran ship shortly after the Federation and the Cardassians signed a treaty. Admiral Kennely asks Picard to locate the terrorist's base and to bring their leader to the Cardassian system so that peace between the two people's may be arranged.  Admiral Kennely orders Picard to take onboard ship an ensign with a less than honorable past. Ensign Ro had been involved in an incident where she was responsible for the death of a landing party, courtmartialed and imprisoned in the stockade. Admiral Kennelly had her released because she is Bajoran and might be of help on the mission. But Ensign Ro has her own orders and may be part of a Federation conspiracy.	It is a typical day as Mot trims Captain Picard's hair in the barbershop while dispensing advice on strategy while in adversarial situations with the Romulans. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Commander Riker, who reports that the USS Enterprise-D has just received a distress call from a colony on Solarion IV. As Picard leaves, Mot observes how close Solarion is to the Cardassian border and points out that he told them not to colonize it. When Picard arrives on the bridge, there is an audio-only communication from a Bajoran man claiming responsibility for destroying the colony and threatening more violence if their homeland is still kept from them.

Straight-faced, Riker advocates ""William"" as the perfect name. O'Brien excuses himself, patting Keiko's belly and addressing it as ""Michael"", telling them he's due on the bridge for a transporter simulation. In a cargo bay, Lieutenant Commander La Forge and Dr. Crusher are inventorying a collection of supply canisters. She is trying to convince him to audition for a part in her latest play, and he reluctantly sings a few lines of ""I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General"" from The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan. He protests that he is too bashful to sing in front of other people, but Crusher insists that he is perfect, just that his musical tone was a little off, and puts his name down for the role. On the bridge, Counselor Troi introduces three children to Captain Picard as the winners of the school science fair, whose prize is a tour of the ship with the captain. Forcing down his usual awkwardness with children, Picard greets himself but refuses when asked by one of his charges if they can see the battle bridge or torpedo bay, instead offering to take them round less sensitive (and less interesting sounding) areas, such as the hydroponics and astrophysics laboratory, forcing a smile onto his face as he conducts the children onto a turbolift to begin the tour, passing a newly-arrived O'Brien. Aboard the lift, Picard tries to make conversation by asking each of the children about their respective projects. The third and oldest member of the group, Marissa Flores, is tongue-tied, and before conversation can go further, the ship is suddenly struck by an impact, and the turbolift plummets, causing the children to scream in panic. The heavy quaking is felt throughout the ship, throwing people around and causing substantial damage before it passes. Aboard the bridge, the crew picks themselves up off the deck and Ops officer Ensign Mandel reports an impact with a quantum filament, and warns that another one is headed for the ship. The conn officer, Lieutenant jg Monroe, only has time to warn all hands to brace for another impact before the ship is hit again and the helm console blows up in her face, sending her to the floor. "	Collision with a quantum filament leaves Troi in charge of a damaged and endangered Enterprise with emergency bulkheads cutting off sections of the ship.

The game apparently stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain while also attacking the reasoning centers. Only Wesley, on leave from the Academy, and his new friend, Robin Lefler remain unaddicted and it is up to them to save the crew.	"Commander Riker is on shore leave on Risa, where he's been spending time with a Ktarian woman named Etana. In his room at the resort he is staying at, she teases him by taking his combadge, and then, to his disbelief, throws it out a window. While they lie down together, Etana introduces to him a game involving a device that fits over the ears and projects signals into the eyes. This creates in the wearer's field of vision an image of discs going into funnels. When a disk goes into one of said funnels, the player is ""rewarded"" by receiving pleasure signals from the device. Etana says that the game can go as far as the player will take it, and Riker decides to continue playing. "	Wesley Crusher returns to the Enterprise on vacation from the Academy only to discover a mysterious alien game infiltrating and controlling the crew.

Picard sees a video picture of the Vulcan, Spock, and his Romulan contact. Picard travels to Vulcan to visit Sarek to find out why Spock went to Romulan and what he hopes to accomplish there. Despite Sarek's illness, Picard is able to see him and discovers that Spock has been in touch with a Romulan senator, Pardek. Sarek asks Picard to convey his love to Spock.  Meanwhile, Geordi and Riker inspect several metal fragments recovered from a Ferengi ship. The fragments are remains of a Vulcan Deflector system and the Federation wants to find out how the Ferengi got hold of them. The Vulcans claim to know nothing about the materials and Riker and Geordi conclude that the equipment was stolen.  When Picard returns to the Enterprise, he summons the help of the Klingons to get a cloaked ship for use to travel undetected to Romulus. After several days of unsuccessfully reaching Gowron, Picard finally gets through and convinces Gowron to provide a vessel. Meanwhile, intelligence reports confirm Spock's meeting with Pardek whom Data identifies as an advocate for peace and reunification of the Vulcans and Romulans.  While Riker and Geordi work together to discover how the Vulcan deflector unit ended up in the hands of the Ferengi, Data and Picard disguise themselves as Romulans and travel to Romulus on the Klingon ship. Once they arrive, they transport down and stop at a cafe near Pardek's office. When they spot Pardek and attempt to approach him, they are captured by Romulan guards. Later, however, they discover that Pardek had them arrested for their own protection. As Picard briefs the senator on their meeting, Spock suddenly appears before him.  This episode is the first episode of a two-part story which links the events in the series to the events in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country which opened at theaters about three weeks after this two-part episode first aired. Spock, Pardek and Sarek were key figures in the Khitomer Conference which is one of the events depicted in the movie.	The USS Enterprise-D has had a terraforming mission on Doraf I cancelled and has been recalled to Starbase 234 by Fleet Admiral Brackett who is unwilling to discuss the matter over subspace. Meeting with Captain Picard in his ready room, she explains to him that one of the Federation's most prestigious and celebrated ambassadors and an advisor to Federation leaders for generations had suddenly disappeared without a trace three weeks ago. Then two days ago, intelligence suggests that the ambassador is currently on the planet Romulus. The trip was unauthorized, and there are serious worries that he has defected. If so, the potential damage to Federation security would be devastating. She shows Picard a distorted image taken on Romulus by long-range scanner on his desktop monitor that, after image enhancement, clearly shows the face of the missing ambassador – Spock. 	Picard and Data follow Spock into Romulan space on a dangerous mission.
106	106	106	106	207	Unification, Part II	5	8	1991-11-11 0:00:00	UNIFICATION, Part II	Unification, Part II	This episode is the second part of the story which began in Unification I.  Picard and Spock talk and Spock is initially uncooperative with Picard but soon accepts that Picard is representing the Federation. Picard informs Spock that his father, Sarek, has died and conveys his love to Spock. This helps Spock accept Picard as an ally and tells him that his mission to Romulus involves a plan to reunify its people with the Vulcans. Picard naturally does not trust the Romulans and Spock does not seem to fully trust either the Romulans or Picard. Picard sends Data back to the Klingon ship to attempt and access the Romulans' computer network.  Meanwhile on the Enterprise, Riker continues to investigate the theft of the deflector unit. He contacts Amarie, the ex-wife of a smuggler who was killed when the Enterprise destroyed an unmarked enemy ship that tried to interfere with the investigation.  Back on Romulus, Senator Pardek brings Picard and Spock to meet with Neral, the Romulan Proconsul who claims to support reunification. However, unknown to Spock and Picard, Neral is in league with Selas who appears in Neral's office after the Federation officers leave. Picard is very skeptical that Neral offered his support so readily without the support of the Romulan traditionalists among the council. Spock too is skeptical but is convinced that logic dictates that it is in the Federation's best interest to proceed whether the Romulans have an ulterior motive or not.  Amarie meanwhile puts Riker in touch with a Ferengi trader who reveals that the Romulans are involved in the theft of Vulcan ships. Riker contacts Picard and informs him of what he has learned. The two agree to rendezvous and Riker heads towards Romulan territory. Data, with Spock's help accesses the Romulan computer network and discovers that Neral and Pardek are out to double-cross them. Picard and Data transport back to Romulus to inform Spock and all are taken prisoner by Sela.  Sela informs them that they plan to use the stolen ships to conquer Vulcan. She plans to force Spock to deliver a speech announcing the approaching ships as a peace envoy but, in fact, they will be manned by soldiers with orders to seize control of the Vulcan government. When Spock refuses to cooperate, Sela shows them a holographic image of Spock, Picard and Data which she plans to use instead to complete her plan. When Sela leaves the room, Data and Spock set to work on the computer system to try and find an escape route. They manage to send an emergency signal to the Enterprise, which already suspects some sort of trick since they have been unable to reach Picard. Picard tells them of Sela's plan and the Enterprise destroys the ships.  Sela returns to her office planning to kill Spock and Picard but instead is tricked by holographic images giving the Federation officers the opportunity to subdue her and escape. Picard and Data return to the Enterprise while Spock decides to remain on Romulus in the hope of truly establishing peace with the Romulans.	"Ambassador Spock asks Captain Picard why he is on Romulus, and Picard tells him he is there to ask him the same question on behalf of Starfleet. Spock refuses to answer, telling Picard that his mission is a personal one of peace and will inform Starfleet when it is necessary. Picard reminds Spock that he is in a position to heavily compromise Federation security; Spock asks Picard to leave and Picard refuses, saying that despite all that he has achieved on behalf of the Federation, Spock's sort of ""cowboy diplomacy"" is not easily tolerated.  ""If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussions for the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'm here as their representative."" Picard also has the unhappy task of informing Spock that his father is dead. Taking a moment to take in the news, Spock then asks Picard to walk with him. Spock reveals that he is aware of the mind meld that Picard and his father shared to allow Sarek to complete his final mission at Legara IV. Picard tells Spock it was an honor, and Spock agrees that Sarek was a great representative for the Vulcan people and for the Federation. Picard then tells Spock of Sarek's pride in him, but Spock brushes this off as part of the emotional onslaught Sarek suffered due to his illness, but Picard disputes this… those feelings came from his father's heart. Spock is uncomfortable with this and starts to tell Picard why he is on Romulus: some time earlier, he became aware of an underground movement learning Vulcan philosophy that have been declared enemies of the Romulan government. However, some members are sympathetic to the cause like Senator Pardek, who was the one who asked Spock to come and take the first step towards the reunification of Vulcan and Romulus. Picard is very surprised: it has been centuries since the Romulan society split from the Vulcan people and have developed several fundamental differences and Spock admits that reunification may be unlikely. However, if it succeeds, the potential benefits brought about would be immense. The 'first step' that Pardek spoke of concerns a young and idealistic proconsul in the Romulan Senate who is promising reform: they may be able to convert him to their movement. When Picard asks Spock why he hasn't mentioned this either to the Federation or to the Vulcans, Spock says that it was a personal decision based on what happened with his small role in the early overtures to peace with the Klingons. ""It was I who committed Captain Kirk to that peace mission, and I who had to bear the responsibility for the consequences to him and to his crew."" Spock states that he is unwilling to risk anyone's life but his own in this venture and once again asks Picard to leave. Picard states that he almost suspects Spock's judgment is being influenced by his emotions. Spock responds that Picard speaks almost as Sarek would if he were there. Picard replies that he speaks only as a Starfleet officer and cannot ignore the risks to Spock. Spock then remarks that Picard is, in his own way, as stubborn as another captain of the USS Enterprise that he once knew. Picard takes that as a compliment, remarking that he is in good company. "	On Romulus, Picard finds Spock, as well as an underground peace movement, a double agent, a bold ulterior motive against the Federation, and a familiar adversary.

On the way, the Enterprise encounters a disturbance in time and spot a ship which materialized in the area of the disturbance. On board the ship is Rasmussen who claims to be a scientist from the future who has returned to this exact day and time to watch Picard and the Enterprise perform their current mission.	The USS Enterprise is trying to fix extreme weather problems resulting from an asteroid collision on the planet Penthara IV, a colony with a population of some twenty million persons. On their way to Penthara IV, Worf notices a space-time distortion, followed by the appearance of a small vessel. Captain Picard tries to hail the ship, to which the occupant replies that Picard should move over. Picard takes a stand saying that the Enterprise will not go anywhere until the man explains himself. But the problem is clarified as soon as Picard takes a step away from the position on the bridge where he was standing: the man immediately beams onto the same location. He introduces himself as Berlinghoff Rasmussen, a historian from the future (specifically, the 26th century), specializing in 24th century interstellar issues. He tells Picard he has come back almost three hundred years to find them. 	Reaching Penthara IV after an asteroid wreaks havoc of catastrophic proportions, the Enterprise crew deals with trying to save the planet as well as deal with someone who claims to be a historian from the future.

While in the sector, Worf's mother visits the ship with Worf's son, Alexander who has been having difficulties living on Earth.  Alexander stays on the Enterprise and enrolls in school but he appears to be a liar, a thief and a bully. Worf must learn to build a relationship with Alexander and learn how to be a father.  Meanwhile, the experimental ship and Soliton Wave perform beautifully at first but, something goes wrong - a power fluctuation causes the wave to go out of control, destroying the test ship and damaging the Enterprise's engines, shields and sensors. The wave, at an unexpected energy level, heads toward a populated colony at warp speed and, if it hits the colony will completely destroy it. The Enterprise must find a way to stop the wave before it is too late.	"In engineering, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge is visibly excited about the history-making events about to transpire. He likens it to being present to see Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier or Zefram Cochrane engage the first warp drive. Lieutenant Commander Data and Lieutenant Worf don't share his enthusiasm. La Forge leaves them to talk with Crewman Donaldson, a fellow engineer who may be more receptive.  Worf receives a subspace communication from the transport ship Milan. It is Worf's mother, Helena Rozhenko, who has brought with her Worf's son, Alexander, to visit. Worf makes arrangements for them to come aboard. In the transporter room, Worf greets his mother and son stiffly and asks ""How long can you stay?"", to which Alexander replies, ""I'm not going back."" "	Geordi can barely curtail his enthusiasm at being able to test out a new theory of transportation, as Worf's mother boards the Enterprise with his son and news that Worf's Earthly parents can no longer care for him.

When they get there, they find the ship has been destroyed and the only survivor is a young boy who tells them that the ship was destroyed by an unknown enemy.  The boy suffers from the trauma of losing his parents and latches on to Data as his friend and hero. The boy begins emulating Data as a way of coping with the tragedy. Meanwhile, the Enterprise crew tries to discover the identity of the unknown assailants that destroyed the research ship.	The USS Enterprise-D arrives at the designated coordinates of the black cluster, scanning for the Vico within the cluster. The vessel appears to be adrift and the sensors can detect no life signs. The Vico has experienced multiple hull breaches, but it is determined that it is barely safe enough for an away team to beam over. Riker, La Forge, and Data beam on board the vessel. While on board, they gain access to the ship's computer core and begin downloading the vessel's records and logs. While they are beginning this process, the away team finds a young boy caught under the wreckage of the damaged ship. 	Data rescues an orphaned boy named Timothy from a damaged ship. As a way to repress his own pain, Timothy begins to mimic Data's personality.

Interviewing Keiko O'Brien in Ten Forward, Tarmin probes her memory of a cup, which she knows is important but whose context she cannot recollect. With his help, Keiko remembers bit by bit that it was used by her obachan to wash brushes used in Japanese calligraphy. She thanks the Ullians for the retrieval of the pleasant memory. Tarmin attempts to persuade Dr. Crusher to undergo the probe but is reminded by Jev that they are not to probe people without permission. 	Transporting three Ullian mind-probing historians, the Enterprise crew is stymied when some of its members fall into a coma. Deanna Troi, the first crew member to come through it, cannot recall anything surrounding the incident.

Unfortunately, a large stellar mass is about to pass through that region of space and the gravitational forces would destroy the colony. The Enterprise must help the colony to find a way to destroy the mass without destroying the carefully controlled society that has been built.  This episode is mosty a retread of ""For the World is Hollow, and I've Touched the Sky"" from the old series, complete with the isolated society, the Enterprise crewmember that falls in love with the local, and the major disaster that's about to destroy the colony unless the Enterprise can stop it.  "	While the USS Enterprise-D crew is observing the fragment, they find that Moab IV, one of the planets it would affect as it passes by, is inhabited by Humans and that an artificial environment biosphere has been created there on the southern continent. When they contact the inhabitants, after a reluctant response by Aaron Conor, Picard arranges for Commander Riker and an away team to beam down. 	Working together to prevent the annihilation of a perfectly balanced, isolated society (with no contingency for outside visitors) may, in fact, destroy it.

They soon come to believe that they have been ordered to penetrate into the heart of the Lysian system and to destroy them. As they struggle to regain their lost memories, they struggle against the moral conflict of totally destroying a race that clearly is not their technological equal.	As the crew is going through a typical day, with Data in Ten Forward fixing Deanna Troi a Samarian sunset done in the traditional style to settle a bet over a three-dimensional chess game, Dr. Beverly Crusher tending to Kristin, a crewmember injured while cliff-diving on the holodeck, and Commander Riker arguing with Ensign Ro about her changing ship's procedure without his knowledge, the USS Enterprise-D is approached by a small vessel of unknown configuration. After the vessel initiates an intense scan of the Enterprise, a wave of green energy passes throughout the ship, and the entire crew suffers from memory loss.  	When an approaching alien ship wipes their memory, the crew struggles to put back together what happened.

Although the signal leads to an uninhabited moon, Troi is convinced that there is someone still alive. Due to a magnetic storm on the moon, the Enterprise is unable to use the transporters so Riker, Troi and Data attempt to use a shuttlecraft to land on the moon on a rescue mission but, the craft is destroyed by the storm.  They are joined by O'Brien who has found a way to use the transporter for a single beaming and to rig up a booster so they may be rescued by the transporters. As they are about to beam up, the storm lets loose a lightning bolt which knocks the crew unconscious. Riker manages to come to long enough to activate the booster and they are all returned to the ship.  Shortly after their return, Data, Troi, and O'Brien begin to behave strangely and they attempt to take over the ship. When their attempted mutiny fails, they run for ten-forward where they take hostage Keiko, Worf and other crew members. Picard must find a way to free the hostages, and discover why Data, Troi and O'Brien have attempted to take over the ship.	As the USS Enterprise-D attempts to identify the source of the distress call, they are confronted with extreme interference due to electromagnetic whirlwinds on the moon, which renders the sensors incapable of picking up life signs. However, Commander Data is able to identify the distress call to be consistent with that of Daedalus-class starships, which, however, have not been in service for 172 years. Captain Picard asks Data to check if any starships have been reported missing in this area. Data determines that the USS Essex under the command of Captain Bryce Shumar disappeared in the vicinity, over two hundred years ago. He also determines, that the signal from the moon is identical to the subspace signature from the Essex. The captain thinks that they have solved the mystery of the Essex, seeing no need to risk beaming down to check a ghost ship, and orders Lt. Worf to notify Starfleet. However, in that moment, Counselor Deanna Troi tells the captain that they have not necessarily solved the mystery of the missing ship, since she senses life on the moon's surface. 	A long-lost ship is found on a planet where cosmic storms prevented detection for 200 years. When a surface landing goes wrong, the away team is beamed back...with a few extra surprises.

Even in Dr. Crusher's time, this is one injury that cannot be easily mended and Worf must face the ethical choice between an experimental procedure proposed by Dr. Russell, a Klingon ritual suicide or living life as a cripple.  Worf asks Riker for his assistance in committing suicide, a ritual performed by an honorable Klingon who is irreparably injured. Riker must face his own ethical decision - help a friend to die by suicide, or help a friend to live.  Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher must find a way to deal with a doctor whose medical judgement and practice is highly unethical. Dr. Russell is a doctor that is willing to test highly experimental, untested treatments on live patients, with or without their consent, regardless of the possible results and often without attempting more traditional treatments. One of Dr. Russell's experimental treatments kills a patient, even though a more standard treatment may have saved the patient's life. On the other hand, Dr. Russell's experimental procedure for scanning and re-creating body parts, may be the only thing that can save Worf.	Lieutenant Worf and Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge are in Cargo Bay 3 investigating strange readings. Their tricorders are unable to detect the exact problem. Worf is preoccupied with his loss to Counselor Deanna Troi in a poker game, and no one realizes that a large, heavy container sitting on a high shelf is leaking. Another similar container is sitting on top of it. Eventually, enough of the material leaks out that the lower container begins to buckle under the weight of the upper container. The two containers fall, and the upper container hits Worf in his back. La Forge rushes over to the immobile Worf and summons emergency medical assistance. Worf wakes up in sickbay and at first he believes he is being held by a restraining field to keep him from leaving. Grim faced, Dr. Crusher informs him that his spinal cord has been crushed, resulting in paralysis. 	After an accident that leaves him no longer able to walk, Worf asks Riker to help him commit suicide.

Three of them are on the bridge observing the effort. Data detects neutrino emissions, but can detect no source. They launch a probe, but after a few seconds it vanishes and stops transmitting for no reason. 	While aiding an androgynous race who lost a couple of members in an unmapped region of space, Riker falls for one of them, which can lead to trouble if detected, since the alien race does not endorse gender specificity.

The USS Enterprise-D is in dire straits, with the starboard warp nacelle having suffered extreme damage from an impact. As casualty reports flood in and the ship's systems start failing, Commander Riker orders all hands to proceed to escape pods as La Forge tries desperately to shut down the warp engines. At that moment, the nacelle completely blows out, sending the Enterprise into a helpless spin. Data reports that the engine shutdown failed, ejection systems are off-line, and a warp core breach is imminent. As a fire engulfs the bridge, Captain Picard orders all hands to abandon ship.

Troi believes that Clara imagined Isabella as she moves from ship to ship often due to her father's career, and hasn't had the opportunity to sustain a friendship.  While the Enterprise explores the nebula, a small sphere of energy enters the Enterprise and roams about the corridors, sickbay, and finally the arboretum, where Clara is assisting Keiko O'Brien in planting nasturtium seeds. While there talking to the invisible Isabella, to her surprise, the imaginary friend appears to Clara in the arboretum seemingly in the flesh. 	The Enterprise finds a lone Borg drone, separated from the collective, and brings him aboard. The drone begins to reassert his individuality, but his presence causes differing levels of fear and sympathy from various crew members.

Ro and Geordi are presumed dead, but they have not died. They discover they are in a cloaked, phased state where they can see and hear the crew but the crew cannot see or hear them. As they attempt to deal with their situation they uncover a plot by the Romulans to destroy the Enterprise and must find a way to return to normal, if possible, and warn their fellow crewmembers.	The USS Enterprise-D is called to render assistance to a crippled Romulan vessel. When they arrive, the vessel is adrift and has taken heavy damage. Commander William T. Riker, Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Ensign Ro Laren, and Lieutenant Worf beam over. Riker orders La Forge and Ro to disarm their phasers before going over, which Ro says is not a bright idea, drawing Riker's ire. When La Forge surveys the damage after beaming aboard, he determines that the graviton generator needs to be replaced, and beams himself and Ro back to the ship along with the damaged part. However, during transport, something happens to their patterns. Transporter chief Brossmer cannot get their patterns to rematerialize, so she aborts the transport. However, they do not rematerialize at the original coordinates as the safety protocols indicated. Riker and the engineer conclude they are gone. 	A transporter malfunction, combined with a Romulan ship under stress and a damaged cloaking device, creates the illusion that Ensign Ro and Geordi are dead, but Geordi doesn't believe it to be so, and he acts accordingly.

Most of the artifacts are from 19th century Earth except for one - the remains of Data's head apparently left there sometime in the past where Data was destroyed. The crew finds traces of Triallic Waves in the cavern and traces them back to Devidia Two where they find yet another cave - this one inhabited by beings who are slightly out of phase with our universe. Data assists Geordi in building a Sub-Space distorter to align the synchronic distortion. As Data uses the distorter, the beings inhabiting the area use a temporal distorter and Data is caught in the waves and sent to Earth in the late 19th century.	"Captain Picard and Lieutenant Commander Data enter an underground cavern in San Francisco with a scientist where work crews have discovered some artifacts dating back to the 19th century. Data notes the presence of a ""bifocal visual aid"" that is typical for the era and a revolver which is identified as a "".45 caliber double action cavalry pistol invented by Colt Firearms in 1873."" A gold watch is also present with the inscription ""To S.L.C. With Love 30 November 1889."" The time on the watch is 9:39:46. The scientist leading them explains that the work crews installing seismic regulators in the cavern under San Francisco were having difficulty with the phase conditioners due to the composition of the walls of the cavern. Data scans the rock walls with a tricorder and determines that the rock face has been altered by exposure to triolic waves which are foreign to Earth in both the 19th and the 24th centuries.  Picard wonders aloud why the Enterprise would be called back for such a discovery when there surely are experts on Earth better suited for an investigation. The scientist reveals that there is one more item they found that he has not shown them yet. He lifts a cover to reveal Data's severed head. "	Captain Picard and his archaeological curiosity are called upon by scientists from Earth when they find evidence to support beliefs that aliens had visited Earth in the late 1800s.

Picard meets Guinan for the second time although it's Guinan's first meeting with Picard (aren't time paradoxes wonderful?). Mark Twain is portrayed by Mr. Hardin as a nosy, suspicious cuss who follows Riker, Troi, Dr. Crusher and Geordi back to the future and volunteers to return to the past in order to save the captain and returning him to the Enterprise.	"The year is 1893 and Samuel Clemens is walking down a street in San Francisco, California with a young reporter in tow writing down much of what Clemens is saying on a notepad while he discusses time travel. He expresses his belief that there are people from the future, ""right here in San Francisco."" Their discussion ends when Clemens sees Lt. Cmdr. Data emerge from a building nearby and begins walking up the street. As he follows Data, they unknowingly pass a woman walking with a man who is carrying a walking stick with the head of a snake on it. "	Captain Picard and crew follow Data back to the late 1800s to get him back, only to find the suspected alien visitors killing people of that time.

The Enterprise is sent to search for a research vessel that had been exploring a strange plasma cloud and lost contact with the Federation. Because of ionization in the cloud, the Enterprise is forced to link their transporter to the research vessel's in order to be able to transport to that ship to investigate the disappearance of its crew. Lt. Barclay turns out to be afraid of transporters but is finally convinced that there is ""nothing to be afraid of"" in the transporter. On his return voyage from the research vessel however, Barclay sees strange things floating in the beam along with him and one apparently bites him on his arm. He then begins acting rather strangely (even for him) as the crew of the Enterprise continue their investigation into the mystery of the research ship and its missing crew.  "	The USS Enterprise-D responds to the stricken vessel USS Yosemite. The crew of the Yosemite all have disappeared and due to its proximity to a plasma streamer, the only way to get there safely is by bridging the transporter systems of the two ships. As the away team prepares to beam over one by one, Transporter Chief O'Brien informs each of them that due to disturbances in the plasma field, they may be experiencing problems during transportation. When Lieutenant Barclay hears this, he becomes very nervous and refuses to transport over, rushing out of the transporter room soon after Worf, Riker, and Doctor Crusher all have beamed over to the Yosemite. 	Overcoming his fear of transporter, Lt. Barclay joins an away team, only to find something in the beam with him.

Although the Ambassador would rather travel in a transport ship to avoid any show of military strength, the Enterprise is assigned to convey him to the negotiations. On board the Enterprise, Alcar's mother dies a sudden death and Alcar asks Troi to partake in a memorial ceremony with him. After that ceremony, Troi begins to act strangely and begins aging rapidly.	As the USS Enterprise-D approaches the transport ship, two Rekag battle cruisers turn tail, unwilling to face the far superior firepower of the Enterprise. Talmadge, the captain of the Dorian contacts the Enterprise with relief, explaining that he is carrying a mediator to Seronia. He asks Captain Picard's permission to transfer him and his companion to the Enterprise. Picard agrees and orders Counselor Troi to see to their needs in the transporter room. In the transporter room, Troi meets Ambassador Ves Alkar and an elderly woman, Sev Maylor – his mother. The old woman immediately reacts to Troi with hostility and jealousy, accusing her of being attracted to Alkar. He explains that she hasn't been feeling well and asks that she be taken to their quarters. Troi stands there, looking shocked, especially after Maylor warns her not to pursue him, intones that she will not have it, and she will stop Troi.

128	128	128	128	230	Relics	6	4	1992-10-10 0:00:00	RELICS	Relics	While investigating a Dyson sphere, the Enterprise finds the wreck of the U.S.S. Jenolan, which had crashed while investigating the sphere. On board that ship, locked in a diagnostic loop in the transporter system they discover Captain Montgomery Scott, who had put himself and another crewmember into the transporter system to await rescue. Scotty had been on his way to a retirement planet when his transport ship crashed on the sphere. The Enterprise eventually is trapped inside the Dyson sphere with the sun about to explode and Scotty and LaForge must find a way to save the ship using the wrecked Jenolan.  The best part of this episode was watching Scotty reminisce about events from the old series (bonus points if you could name the episodes he referred to) and watching him learn about the technology 75 years after his own day as Chief Engineer. It was also nostalgic seeing the old Enterprise bridge again, even if it was on the holodeck.	"The USS Enterprise-D picks up a distress call from the USS Jenolan, a transport vessel that has been missing for seventy-five years. As the Enterprise drops out of warp and initiates a Code 1-Alpha-Zero to respond to the signal, the starship is rocked violently by a massive gravitational field. Although initial scans do not find the source of the field, they trace the field to its center and discover a massive spherical structure, two hundred million kilometers in diameter (about 2/3 of the Earth's orbital diameter around the Sun). The sphere's dimensions are consistent with those of the (until then) theoretical structure known as a Dyson sphere. Captain Picard is not surprised that Commander Riker has never heard of the old postulation of 20th century physicist Freeman Dyson, explaining that a hollow sphere built around a star could harness all of its radiant energy and provide a population, living on the interior surface of the sphere like any habitable planet, with a nearly inexhaustible source of power. The sphere's size creates massive gravimetric interference that interferes with sensors, preventing the Enterprise from locating it before the ship had dropped out of warp. The Enterprise locates the Jenolan, having crashed on the surface of the sphere. Surprisingly, several small power readings are still emanating from the crashed ship and life support systems are still operating, on minimal levels. Riker, Lieutenant Commander La Forge and Lieutenant Worf beam aboard the Jenolan and find that, although some of the ship's systems are still functioning, there are no apparent signs of life. However, La Forge discovers that the transporters have been reconfigured in a strange manner – power has been drawn from the auxiliary systems (they were a regenerative power source) and pattern buffers locked to cycle in a Level 4 diagnostic mode. Riker works out that by leaving the transporter in the diagnostic mode, it rerouted the matter array through the pattern buffer. Furthermore, La Forge finds a pattern is still in the buffer and, amazingly, it has suffered almost no degradation, less than 0.003%. Riker wonders if someone could survive in the transporter buffer for seventy-five years and La Forge finds out by rematerializing the stored pattern. Captain Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott materializes on the transporter pad, his left arm in a makeshift sling of torn uniform cloth. "	The Enterprise stumbles upon a Dyson sphere, with a ship crashed on the outer surface. An away team finds some systems still powered up and the chief engineer from the old Enterprise, Montgomery Scott, locked in the transporter cycle.

The experiment has caused a dimensional rift in one of the cargo bays and as it grows in size, more members of the crew begin complaining of exhaustion and other strange symptoms. All of the crew who suffer from the odd ailments have one thing in common - the memory of a strange room with an examining table in it.	"William T. Riker is tossing and turning in bed in his quarters, having trouble getting to sleep. He struggles to get out of bed and groans as he makes his way to his Head. After washing his face, he hears a buzzer on his wall panel and checks and realizes he is late and shakes his head in disbelief. Geordi La Forge and Data work on charting the cluster and the former orders Lieutenant Shipley to triangulate the sector points. Riker comes in and apologizes for being late. La Forge brings him up to speed and tells him how he is attempting to speed up the process of charting the immense globular cluster. He just listens and struggles to pay attention. La Forge wants to boost the long-range sensor array using the warp drive. Afterward, Data asks Riker if he will be attending his poetry reading later in the afternoon in Ten Forward. Riker tiredly tells him he ""wouldn't miss it for the world."" La Forge grins at Riker and tells him he can't wait to see what Data has come up with. Later that afternoon, Data reads some of his poetry. The rhyme and meter are perfect, but there is no emotional content to it as most of the audience looks rather bored. Riker is very obviously tired, falling asleep twice while Data recites a self-made poem he wrote for his cat, Spot, titled ""Ode to Spot"". "	Commander Riker's inability to fall asleep begins to show in other members of the crew in other forms, putting the Enterprise on the trail of a mystery.

Amanda Rogers has come aboard the USS Enterprise-D as an intern while the crew are helping Tagra IV with its worsening ecological state. Rogers is speaking with Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher in the captain's ready room about assisting with some medical experiments, and how she eventually wants to go to Starfleet Academy. She explains she feels very lucky she was accepted as intern out of hundreds of other applicants. Commander Riker enters the ready room and leads Rogers to her quarters, but she unexpectedly seems to know much about the ship's layout already. Entering her quarters, she explains she wishes her three pet dogs were present, and displays an unmistakable attraction to the commander. After Riker leaves, several puppies appear in her quarters. She is dismayed and tells them that they have to go. The dogs gradually disappear. 	When an honor student in the medical field is assigned to the Enterprise in an internship manner, she begins to demonstrate powers of the Q, prompting you-know-who to show up.

On the way back from shore leave on Malonia, the shuttlecraft carrying Picard, Guinan, Keiko and Ro gets caught in an unknown energy field. As the shuttle is about to break up, they are transported off the ship but they appear on the Enterprise's transporter pad as youngsters. Dr. Crusher must find the cause and a cure while the Enterprise races to rescue scientists on Ligos 7 who have sent out a distress signal. Upon reaching the Ligos system, the Enterprise is ambused by renegade Ferengi who are out to use the crew as slave labor and sell the Enterprise...at a high profit.	Captain Picard, Ro Laren, Keiko, and Guinan are returning to the starship aboard the Enterprise-D shuttlecraft Fermi. Their recent visit to Marlonia was a botanic and archaeology expedition, during which Keiko found a specimen of Draebidium calimus and Picard found 700-year-old crockery, with inscriptions somewhat resembling early Taguan but more closely resembling Barolian designs. Suddenly, their shuttlecraft is enveloped by an energy anomaly. They are beamed out of the emergency, but their transport to the Enterprise is difficult – Chief O'Brien having been puzzled by the implications of a forty-percent drop in mass of the transportees, believing that he has lost one of them. When the four members of the away party are beamed aboard the ship, they and O'Brien are shocked by the materialization, on the transporter platform, of a twelve-year-old captain, bartender, botanist, and Bajoran ensign, instead of their adult selves. 	An emergency beam out renders four crewmen down to childhood shortly before renegade Ferengi take over the Enterprise and offload the adults.

Picard attempts to learn the recorder, Dr. Crusher, with Commander Riker work on rehearsals for a play, Geordi and Data work on an experiment to tie Data in to the computer system, and Worf, Alexander and Counselor Troi enjoy themselves in a holodeck adventure set in the ""Ancient West"" sic in which Worf and Alexander are the sheriff and deputy faced with the task of bringing Eli Hollander to justice. Troi takes the role of Durango, the ""mysterious stranger just passing through town.""  Problems ensue however, when a power flux causes part of the Enterprise computer system to be replaced by part of Data's programming. The part of the computer system that's affected - the part that controls recreational activities. Dr. Crusher's play is replaced by Data's poetry, Picard's music is replaced by music Data had been recently studying, Data starts behaving oddly, and the holodeck adventure takes an unplanned, and deadly turn.  In this episode, ably directed by Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner plays six additional roles besides Data. For those playing spot the actor, Brent replaced John Pyper Ferguson as Eli Hollander, appeared as Eli's father, Frank, appeared as Hollander's two henchmen, and appeared at the end of the adventure in drag as Annie; the sixth appearance was the hardest to spot - Brent also played the man sitting in the rocker at the beginning of the holodeck adventure.  "	"In his quarters, Captain Picard is trying to record a piece by Mozart with the Ressikan flute, but he is interrupted by Lieutenant Commanders Data and La Forge. They ask for permission to experiment with creating an interface between Data's positronic brain and the ship's computers, so he can act as an emergency backup system in case of ship-wide systems failure. Picard enthusiastically grants them permission and goes back to the recording when they leave, but is interrupted again by Doctor Beverly Crusher. She wants him to perform in her next play, ""Something for Breakfast""; when he protests about his lack of free time and acting skill, Crusher explains she only wants to cast him in the minor role of the Butler, and assures him he can do it, reminding him of the rehearsal time as she exits. Picard again resumes the recording but is almost immediately interrupted for a third time by Worf, who presents a proposed schedule for security drills. When Picard suggests the drills should wait for the new personnel soon to come aboard from Starbase 118, Worf suggests he make maintenance checks on the forward phaser array instead, but the captain tells him to enjoy himself during this free time and to make good use of it. Worf, slightly baffled, thanks him and leaves Picard to resume his recording, who begins yet again from the top. In Worf's quarters, his son, Alexander is lying on the floor while he plays with his computer. He jumps up when he hears his father entering the room and he asks what the captain said, Worf lets himself fall into a chair and after a short silence reluctantly admits that he has been released from his duties for the duration of the delay. When Alexander asks him if this means that he can go with him, Worf told him he could. Alexander cheerfully announces, ""Saddle up, Father!"", and places a Stetson hat onto Worf's head. There seems to be no way to escape his son's idea of recreation. "	While the crew is experiencing some much needed down time, Worf and his son go on an Old West excursion in the holodeck, where they meet several versions of Data serving as the bad guy after an experiment in Engineering goes wrong.

She uses the exocomps to repair problems on the station and believes that with a little work, they can be used to solve a multitude of problems faced by other workers in other applications. The only problem is, Data believes the exocomps have become self-aware, intelligent beings.	Riker, Worf, La Forge, and Crusher are playing poker in Riker's quarters, and the small talk drifts towards beards as, with La Forge recently deciding to grow his, all the men are sporting one. Crusher comments on her superstitious distrust of bearded men and decides on an unusual stake. If she wins the next hand, all the men will have to shave off their beards; if one of them win, she will become a brunette. After La Forge lays down an aggressive bet to open the hand, Crusher calls his bet immediately, which draws a very nervous call from Riker, but La Forge assures the first officer he has this. It’s as far as they get, though, as Captain Picard summons them to the bridge, much to the disappointment of the doctor.  The USS Enterprise-D arrives at Tyrus VIIA to evaluate the technology for possible use on Carema III. While Lieutenant Commander La Forge is talking with the project lead, Doctor Farallon, a malfunction occurs in one of the station's power grids. Dr. Farallon uses this opportunity to show Commander La Forge another project she has been working on, an exocomp: adaptive tools used for maintenance purposes. The exocomp is sent into an access tunnel, and repairs the malfunction very quickly, preventing a shutdown of the station's core which would have taken four months to return to its power level again. Aboard the Enterprise, Data asks how the repair of the power grid was completed so quickly. La Forge, glancing down at the exocomp with Farallon, tells Data that he is not quite sure. 	When Geordi is assigned to survey a new mining development with Dr. Farallon, who invented an experimental mining technology, she uses a new sophisticated robot called an Exocomp to repair a power grid.

One of the most powerful episodes of this season, it clearly displays the character of Captain Picard and his inner strength as well as the relationships between him and his crew. Patrick Stewart deserves an Emmy nomination for his performance in this episode, among others - he's certainly demonstrated his excellent acting ability.	Jean-Luc Picard is drugged and questioned by Gul Madred. He sits in the middle of a dark room answering in a monotone. Picard reveals details about his mission to Celtris III and the personnel involved. Madred then asks his prisoner about the defense plans for Minos Korva. Picard truthfully states that he has no knowledge of such plans. Madred has his Cardassian subordinate increase the dosage and has Picard answer the same questions again. 	While the humorless Captain Jellico leads the effort to prevent a Cardassian invasion, Picard is captured and tortured by a ruthless interrogator in an attempt to break him.

While playing in a Holmes adventure on the holodeck, Moriarity manages to gain control of the adventure and the ship and lures Picard, Data, and Barclay into his world and demands they give him entrance to theirs.	Data and Geordi La Forge are enjoying a Sherlock Holmes mystery holodeck program. However, when Data tries to prove the guilt of the alleged murderer by throwing a matchbox at him which he catches with his right hand, Data is puzzled as the program should have rendered the character left handed, which would have conclusively proved Data's accusation. La Forge, agreeing this seems like a malfunction, freezes the program and calls for Reginald Barclay, asking him to come down and examine the program, as this certainly was not the first time something went wrong with it. After saving the program, Data and La Forge run into Barclay outside the holodeck. Barclay thinks it might have been a glitch in the matrix diodes and assures them he will solve the problem.  While performing a diagnostic on all files concerning Sherlock Holmes program 3A via the holodeck arch, he discovers files stored in protected memory. When Barclay runs the files contained within the arch, Professor James Moriarty appears, standing in the center of the holodeck. Barclay engages him and, unprompted, throws his diagnostic device at him and establishes Moriarty is left handed, as he should be. Moriarty throws the tool to the floor and demands to see Captain Picard, surprising Barclay, who is unaware of the previous encounter with Moriarty four years prior. Barclay is shocked to hear that Moriarty really knows what he is, a holodeck character, and even more so when he learns that Moriarty experienced the passage of time. Denying Moriarty's claim that he is alive, Barclay tells him that he cannot leave the holodeck when he is asked if this is possible. Moriarty suspects that Picard has forgotten all about him since their first meeting, only agreeing to try to help him leave the holodeck in order to rescue his hostage. He demands to see Picard in the sitting room at 221B Baker Street. Barclay explains that he needs to store Moriarty in memory again until he has contacted Captain Picard. When Moriarty is gone, Barclay leaves the holodeck, but a brief moment later Moriarty reappears again with an amused smile on his face. 	Lt. Barclay mistakenly awakes Moriarty in the forgotten holodeck program, who then makes his demands clear and unforgettable.

As Dr. Crusher struggles to save his life, Q takes Picard on a journey through his past and offers Picard the chance to avoid the fight that cost him his real heart.	"In sickbay, Dr. Crusher orders the stasis units to be brought on-line and tells one of the medical staff that Dr. Selar can use Ward 3 for the ambulatory patients while she attends to the away team in the main area of sickbay. The away team, consisting of Commander Riker, Worf, Ensign Kellogg, and two security officers are transported in. After Worf lays Picard down on the biobed, she asks how he was injured. Riker tells her that they were attacked by the Lenarians just outside a conference room. Dr. Crusher quickly deduces that Captain Picard has essentially had a heart attack, due to his artificial heart. She and Martinez, along with other medical staff, desperately try to save the captain, though it seems that they are unable to. Picard suddenly finds himself in a white void of dazzling brilliance seemingly uninjured, except for the large burn on his uniform from the weapon that he was attacked with. After looking around with confusion for a few seconds, Picard sees a shining figure dressed in white holding out its hand. Picard cautiously walks towards the figure, who then holds out his hand. After Picard shakes hands with the figure, he is pulled into focus and turns out to be Q, who greets him with ""Welcome to the afterlife, Jean-Luc. You're dead."" "	When Captain Picard's artificial heart fails, he is offered the rare opportunity to go back in time and set right the mistake that led to his demise.

Dr. Bashir is caught by Data using the Enterprise computer system to analyze medical equipment discovered in the Gamma quadrant. During their investigation, Data is struck by an energy beam from the equipment causing him to lose consciousness and experience a dormant program installed by his creator that was meant to be activated when Data achieved a certain level of development.  Meanwhile, Worf meets an alien, Shrek, in the promenade who convinces Worf that his father did not die at Kitomer but instead is living as a prisoner of the Romulans. Worf travels with Shrek to the prison planet in an attempt to find his father.	As Jean-Luc Picard and Beverly Crusher walk down Deep Space 9's Promenade, Crusher tells Picard that she is eager to visit Quark's holosuites, especially a relaxation program from Alture VII. Picard has no time for relaxation, since he is due to meet with ten Bajoran bureaucrats to discuss the repair of the Bajoran aqueducts. He and Crusher walk into one of the station's turbolifts and head to Ops. Meanwhile, Worf and Geordi La Forge are in the Replimat, eating pasta al fiorella. La Forge wants to visit the station's Ktarian antique shop, as he hears they have a 21st century plasma coil that is supposedly in perfect condition. As they eat, a Yridian is watching Worf from the upper level of the Promenade.  On the Enterprise bridge, Data detects a power drain in the starboard EPS conduits in sickbay. Someone has made an unauthorized access into the computer's bio-imaging systems from his console. Commander Riker tells Data that he had better go investigate it. In sickbay, Dr. Julian Bashir is studying a strange device. When Data arrives to assess the situation, Bashir explains that the device was discovered in the Gamma Quadrant, that he believes it to be some sort of medical imaging scanner, and that the Enterprise's sickbay systems can analyze it far better and faster than his limited computer resources on Deep Space 9 can. Data suggests that they take the device to engineering and have La Forge assist them with the analysis. The Yridian introduces himself to Worf as Jaglom Shrek and tells him that he is a man who has information to sell. Worf confidently tells Shrek that he possesses no information he could possibly want. As Worf gets up to leave, Shrek reveals that his late father, Mogh, is in fact alive. 	While visiting Deep Space 9, a Yridian tells Worf his father lives, and a discharge from an alien device puts Data in a dream state where he meets his own father.

After Worf is captured by the Romulans, he is told he will have to stay at the camp. He learns from L'Kor and Gi'ral the story of the Klingons who were captured. Their deflector shields were taken out and they were knocked unconscious due to the explosions on a Klingon outpost during the Khitomer Massacre. When they awoke in the prison camp, they failed to kill themselves through starvation. After interrogation, the Romulans tried to trade them for territory, but the Klingon Empire refused to accept that their warriors would have allowed themselves to be captured. When Tokath, the Romulan officer who captured them, offered to let them go, they did not wish to return and bring dishonor on their families. He took pity on them and built the prison camp. Their own honor gone, the Klingons had nothing left to lose by staying prisoners. L'Kor asks Worf why he came, noting that if he had found his father, he would have found only dishonor. Worf tells him that he would be glad to see him; he states that there is no room in his heart for shame. L'Kor says that if his son had found him here, he hopes he would be Klingon enough to kill him. 	In seeking his father, Worf discovers a prisoner-of-war camp that has evolved into a Klingon/Romulan haven - an Eden where Worf becomes their serpent.

The process is deadly to life so the crew must be evacuated while the station staff do their work. Picard, briefly returning to the ship to get his saddle so he can ride horses on the planet, learns that thieves are attempting to steal the trilithium from the ship and he must stop them single-handedly.	"The USS Enterprise-D is at the Remmler Array where they are scheduled for a baryon sweep, a maintenance cycle that removes large amounts of radiation that builds up in the hulls of starships that travel for extended periods at warp. The sweep is lethal to any organic matter, so there is a flurry of activity as the entire ship is being evacuated prior to the sweep, and various last-minute problems (such as slow progress on Decks 7 and 8 and a lack of stasis units for Dr. Crusher's living tissue samples) are being quickly addressed. Captain Picard is less than enthusiastic over the visit, as he has to meet with Commander Calvin ""Hutch"" Hutchinson, a Starfleet officer known for his gift of gab. Coincidentally, Data is studying the concept of ""small talk"", and during their turbolift ride to the bridge, Data tries to break the silence this way; Picard recommends that Data study Hutchinson so as to learn from an expert on the subject.  Arriving on the bridge, Picard is met by both La Forge and Worf, speaking simultaneously. Worf reports that Picard must give his authorization to disable command functions during the sweep. Then La Forge informs Picard that he needs to install additional field diverters to protect the primary systems on board, such as the computer core and the bridge. He needs the equipment because the amount of radiation in the hull is so high (due to five years of the Enterprise's high amount of warp use–double the average) that the baryon sweep may be more intense than normal. Picard agrees and instructs the ship's computer to shut down the primary systems in 30 minutes, allowing enough time for the diverters to be installed first. Worf then asks permission to be excused from Hutchinson's reception. When La Forge witnesses Picard agree to Worf's request, he attempts to do the same only to be denied because Picard can't excuse all of the senior staff, and Worf asked first and thus beat him to it. Picard then goes to his ready room to confirm the time of the sweep to Orton, the station administrator, and takes one last look around the bridge. He then sees a crew walking onto the bridge to install some equipment. Assuming that was the crew that La Forge ordered, he thinks nothing of it and transports to Hutchinson's reception at the Arkaria Base. "	When the Enterprise puts in to space dock for an energy sweep of the ship which is lethal to humans, Picard gets trapped on board with technicians who are not what they appear to be.

Captain Picard is up and active early in the morning. Entering the bridge at 0300 hours, he finds out from Data that Stellar cartography has ordered the shutdown of several systems he wishes to use, such as communications, as he had wanted to contact a Doctor Mowray at his archaeological dig on Landris II. Understanding initially of the blackout request from stellar cartography and not wishing to override it, Picard goes to his ready room and requests to look at excavation schematics of the site but finds that the library computer is offline as well. Picard goes to his replicator to make his usual order of Earl Grey tea but finds that even the replicator systems are down as well. He decides to head down there and see what they are working on that requires so many systems on the ship to be shut down.  Entering stellar cartography, Picard finds that the room is almost completely dark and hears a voice telling him to either leave or stay but to allow the door to be closed behind him immediately. Despite the entrance to stellar cartography remaining open for only a short time, Picard's unanticipated arrival causes the experiment to fail and the voice the captain had heard in the dark orders the computer to turn on the lights. The female Starfleet officer tells Picard that he just ruined four hours of work by coming in. Picard responds that she could have taken the simple precaution of locking the door. She turns around, now a little less angry knowing that she is speaking to her commanding officer. Picard assumes she is the new head of the department, Lieutenant commander Nella Daren. She explains that she and her team were working on constructing a mathematical model of an emerging star system and explains that they were taking very precise gravimetric readings. She notes that it would not have taken much to throw the readings off. Picard can see that she is very strong-willed and he instantly takes a liking to her.  	Picard falls for the new head of the stellar science services department, but has feelings of misgivings when he's forced to assign her to a dangerous mission.

The professor claims to be on the verge of a remarkable discovery, but will not share the details with the captain unless the captain joins him. Picard declines, and professor Galen leaves the ship but sends a distress call some time later when his ship is attacked by a strange vessel. Professor Galen is killed in the attack and captain Picard continues following Galen's discovery -- something that the Cardassians, the Klingons and the Romulans are all interested in.	While the USS Enterprise-D is studying protostars in the Volterra Nebula, Captain Picard receives a call from Commander Riker, requesting that he join him in the observation lounge. When Picard enters the darkened room, he sees an object sitting on the lounge's table. Riker requests that the computer turn the lights up, revealing himself and an older man standing next to him to Picard as the room brightens. Picard has received an unexpected visit from Galen, a reclusive professor, and personal mentor of his, from Starfleet Academy. In the lounge, Galen gives the captain an extremely rare archaeological gift, an intact third-dynasty Kurlan naiskos, and encourages him to take a leave of absence from Starfleet to go on an expedition of vast importance to the galaxy. 	The crew of the Enterprise must race against various rival powers to uncover an archaeological secret that explains the predominance of humanoid life forms in the galaxy.

Riker begins to see a strange alien figure on the Enterprise, imagines himself captured by aliens, and begins to lose track of what is real and what isn't.	"Commander William T. Riker is looking disheveled and is sitting in a chair in a dark room and arguing with someone that he believes it is his time to be released and to accept his new role in society. He becomes more and more agitated at the person he is speaking with, and stumbles over his words. He then looks to the side of the room and asks if they could go over the lines again, revealing the situation to be only a scene in a play, which Riker is rehearsing on the USS Enterprise-D with Commander Data. The play, Frame of Mind, is a dark story of a man who may or may not be insane, who is imprisoned in a psychiatric ward where a doctor torments him. After a short but excellent performance, he expresses doubt, not sure if he is right for the part. Doctor Beverly Crusher reassures him that he is. She tells him to relax and says he will ""knock 'em dead"" when the play is performed. He rehearses his lines while walking down the corridor, making another officer who is strolling past look at him strangely. But when he gets into the turbolift, he sees an alien, in a science officer's uniform, whom he has never seen before. Riker ignores the alien at first, but then focuses on him at the moment as the doors close.

Only a few of all invited attend - Kurak, Jo'Bril, Christopher and T'Pan. In the first test of the device, the pilot of the shuttlecraft, Jo'Bril dies and Dr. Rega and his theory are discredited leading Beverly to an investigation of the failed experiment and Dr. Rega's subsequent mysterious death, that could cost her her career.  The shuttlecraft used for the experiment is named the ""Justman"" in honor of Bob Justman who was one an associate producer of the original Star Trek.  "	Doctor Beverly Crusher enters her quarters with a PADD in hand, feeling dejected and defeated. With a long sigh, she throws the PADD to her desk and decides to change out of her uniform, when her door chime rings. With reluctance, she allows the visitor and Guinan enters complaining of tennis elbow after Geordi beats her in straight sets. Crusher tells her she had better see Dr. Selar in sickbay, but Guinan refuses as she's very particular about her doctors and only wants to see Crusher.

While he is there, Kahless does, in fact, return causing suspicion in some and fanaticism in others.	The USS Enterprise-D is on its way to the Gariman sector, and undergoes a shift change in the morning. Data had command of the bridge overnight and hands it over to Commander Riker. He reports that the lateral sensor array performed three spectral analyses of the Alwanir Nebula. Riker is barely listening and is glancing back at the tactical station while sitting down in the command chair. Riker quickly realizes that Lieutenant Worf was assigned to the shift as well to relieve Ensign Torigan at tactical, but is late. Riker notes that Worf is never late for duty and brings a security team. He finds him in his quarters, covered in sweat and kneeling before a fire, absorbed in prayer. The room has been arranged like a traditional Klingon shrine. Riker asks Worf what the hell he is doing. Worf, in a trance, just stares at Riker.  	During Worf's crisis of faith on Boreth, Kahless the Unforgettable makes his promised legendary return, but Klingon leader Gowron challenges his authenticity.

The planet is apparently surrounded by an energy field that prevents transport to the planet except during brief periods. When the away team transports down, they find another Will Riker, who was apparently stranded there years ago and who is still very much in love with Deanna Troi.	"In Ten Forward, people are gathered together and a jazz band, with Will Riker at the trombone, is playing ""I Remember You."" From the bar, Deanna Troi requests that he play ""Night Bird"" – a piece Riker has been having difficulty getting right for the past ten years. He hesitantly grants her request when she insists, and just as he is about to start, Lieutenant commander Data calls him to the bridge. Relieved, Riker goes to the bridge, where Data informs him that they will be able to transport down to the surface soon to get to the science outpost due to the use of the transport logs of the USS Potemkin which had last been there. Riker reminisces that he almost didn't make it out of there eight years ago. According to Data, they only have about 26 minutes to beam down to the planet and retrieve the database. There will be only three transport windows open altogether within the next four days, and after that, the next transport window, so Data says, will not occur for another eight years, when the planet's orbit will bring it close enough to the sun to de-phase the distortion field. Riker decides to go in ahead of schedule. When Riker, Worf, Data and an engineer beam down to the outpost, they realize that someone must have been down there, as Riker mentions the station was a mess when he left. Data also draws his attention upward, noticing a hastily made hatch covering up part of the ceiling. Data's tricorder detects a humanoid lifeform approaching, and much to their surprise, they find a man who looks exactly like William Riker. "	Riker's exact duplicate is discovered on Nervala IV. His first order of business: resume his relationship with Deanna. Second order: obey orders from his superior - himself.

"Commander Riker is sitting on one of the biobeds in sickbay with two deep cuts on his forehead. As Dr. Crusher scans the cuts with a medical tricorder, she says that this is not just a scratch and that it serves him right for playing parrises squares like he was twenty-one. She warns that next time he injures himself, he might break his neck which she may not be able to treat as easily. Riker tells her that he wasn't playing parrises squares, however. Dr. Crusher then guesses that he was injured in one of Worf's calisthenics programs, but again she is wrong. Riker tells her that it was, in fact, Spot who injured him – Riker had promised to feed Data's cat while he was away (even though he hates cats) and was attacked while setting down the food. Because of this, Riker suggests that Dr. Crusher feed Spot instead, and the doctor says she'd be happy to (because she loves cats). Riker is then called to the bridge by Lieutenant Worf on the intercom. As Riker leaves sickbay for the bridge, he tosses Crusher a hand phaser, half-joking that she'd need it to feed Spot. As Riker enters the bridge, Worf informs him that they have picked up a distress call on the long range sensors. It is from a Romulan vessel claiming that they have suffered a total engine failure, falling power levels, and failing life support. Although there are signs that the distress call is a trap, Federation policy is to give the benefit of the doubt in these situations. Since the USS Enterprise-D won't rendezvous with Captain Picard's runabout for another thirteen hours, Riker orders a course to meet with the Romulan ship. As a precaution, he orders the shields raised and issues a red alert. Captain Picard and Lieutenant Commanders Data, La Forge, and Counselor Troi are aboard a runabout heading back to rendezvous with the Enterprise. Data turns helm control of the runabout over to the computer and joins Picard, La Forge, and Troi in the aft section of the runabout, who are all sitting at a table finishing their lunches and discussing their thoughts about the conference. Troi talks about a Ktarian scientist, a Dr. Mizan, who wanted her to join him in ""empirical research"" on interspecies reproduction. Other than her encounter with Dr. Mizan, Troi was horribly bored at the conference, as there was little opportunity for those attending a seminar to give their views. The lecturer, Professor Wagner, was the only one with freedom to speak. Picard's experiences were no better – he attended the physiognomy workshop where the lecturer, Dr. Vassbinder, spent an hour giving a dissertation on the ionization effect of warp nacelles, until he realized that the topic was supposed to be psychology. As with Troi, nobody could tell the instructor of his mistake, as he never gave anyone the opportunity to speak, as he himself spoke in incredibly long, unbroken sentences moving from topic to topic. La Forge, on the other hand, enjoyed his time at the warp energy symposium where he was able to physically touch a plasma field. Halfway through speaking, he, Data, and Picard freeze for no apparent reason. Troi is surprised by the sudden stop in the others' movements, but in a matter of seconds, they resume as if nothing had happened. La Forge notices that Troi is somewhat shaken by something and asks her if something is wrong. She isn't sure. "	Aboard a shuttlecraft and en route back to the Enterprise, Picard, LaForge, Data, and Troi find themselves trapped in a time trap of some sort, where the Enterprise is being taken over by Romulans, and the ship, itself, on a course of destruction.

While fighting the Borg, Data gets ""angry"" and kills one of the Borg and later admits that he felt ""pleasure"" in it. He is very confused by the new experiences and seeks to understand them better. When the captured Borg offers him an explanation, Data helps him escape the ship in a shuttlecraft. When the Enterprise follows, they discover the Borg on a remote planet and discover who is behind the new and deadlier Borg.  "	"Data is playing poker on the holodeck with simulations of Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. They engage in a conversation about the curvature of space-time and the ""apple story"". Newton asks why they are playing this ""ridiculous game"". Data tells him that he has found, from playing the game with his shipmates, that it provides a useful forum into the facets of Humanity. He explains that he was curious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact in this setting. Hawking has just laid down a winning hand of four sevens when Riker calls for red alert. The USS Enterprise-D responds to a distress call from Ohniaka III, an outpost with little strategic value. The Enterprise arrives to find a mysterious ship in orbit. An away team consisting of Riker, Worf, Data, and security officer Corelki find that all personnel on the station are dead and it appears that whoever was responsible for the attacks was specifically interested in their deaths. Data overrides a control panel, causing a door to open and revealing that the attackers are the Borg.

Meanwhile, Riker, Worf and most of the crew of the Enterprise follow Picard down to the planet to try and locate the missing members of the away team leaving Dr. Crusher in command of the Enterprise.	After Lore reveals himself to Jean-Luc Picard, Deanna Troi, and Geordi La Forge, the three are confronted by the fact that Data and Lore are now working together. Lore and Data tell Picard that the end of biological life is at hand and the age of completely artificial lifeforms has begun. Lore had apparently found the Borg struggling with the sense of individuality that Hugh had contracted to the Collective. He sees himself and Data as something for the Borg to aspire to and believe in. Lore tells Picard that he, and all others like him, are obsolete. He has Data take them away. 	Before Lore can run risky experiments on Geordi, Troi and Picard, the three seek a way to re-boot Data's ethical program that Lore switched off to pull Data to his side.

Originally, Riker was supposed to chaperone Byleth but the ambassador insists on Worf being his escort instead and, throughout their visit, Byleth orders the frustrated Klingon around seemingly intent on provoking the warrior. Meanwhile, Picard on his way to the Iyaaran homeworld with Vovall, crashlands on a planet where he is rescued by a strange woman who falls in love with him and dotes on him.	"In his quarters, Worf is looking at himself in a mirror. He is in his Starfleet dress uniform trying to get his Klingon baldric placed just right when the door chime sounds off and he asks whoever is standing outside to enter. Commander Riker walks in, wearing his dress uniform as well and hurriedly telling Worf that a group of visiting dignitaries are due to come aboard at any minute. Riker says that if he did not know any better, he would say Worf is procrastinating. Worf states that Klingons do not procrastinate; this issue is merely a tactical delay. Riker straightens out his baldric and Worf mentions that he does not enjoy wearing dress uniforms, finding them to be too much like dresses. Riker finds Worf's comment to be an example of an ""incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude,"" and that he is surprised by him. ""Besides, you look good in a dress,"" Riker jokingly tells Worf, as they walk out of his quarters. The crew of the USS Enterprise-D is welcoming aboard two Iyaaran ambassadors, Loquel and Byleth, who are visiting the ship as part of a cultural exchange that will also send Captain Jean-Luc Picard to their homeworld, Iyar. Before Picard departs, he assigns Counselor Deanna Troi to act as Loquel's liaison and asks Commander Riker to do the same for Byleth. However, Byleth immediately demands that Lieutenant Worf serve as his shipboard guide. Worf reluctantly accepts, and Picard wishes Riker luck with the ambassadors as he departs for Iyar with Voval, the Iyaaran shuttle pilot.

Because of Geordi's implants, he is the best candidate for using the new device. While investigating on board the Raman, Geordi believes he sees his mother whose ship was lost 300 light years away.	Geordi La Forge, Data, and Beverly Crusher are testing an interface in a science lab on the USS Enterprise-D which allows La Forge to use the VISOR's neural implants in his brain, along with an interface suit, to control a probe by remote control. Via this connection, La Forge can use the probe to virtually enter areas that would be far too dangerous for actual crew members to enter, and the probe transmits information directly into La Forge's cerebral cortex, providing him with the sensation that he is actually there.

The USS Enterprise-D is hit on the port nacelle with a barrage of fire from the mercenary vessel where Riker is being held prisoner. To Worf's surprise, the damage was minimal. The same is true when the starboard nacelle is then hit. Troi believes Riker has done something to their weapons, which Data, as acting captain, believes it to be true and sees that they must play along. The Enterprise simulates serious damage and fires back with only minimal phaser power. Picard pretends that phaser hit damaged the vessel's three plasma arrays on their disruptors. This, along with the antimatter containment units buckling forces Baran to order the mercenary ship to withdraw. Data orders the crew to let the ship go, much to Worf's chagrin, assuming that this is what Riker wants them to do. 	Riker and Picard must find out why this intergalactic gang is looting archaeological sites.

"Data is walking through the corridors of the USS Enterprise-D, when he encounters Geordi La Forge standing against a bulkhead. La Forge tells him they have a plasma conduit to install as they are bringing the Enterprise's new warp core online in less than three hours. Data tells him he will proceed to deck 20 and begin modifications. As he leaves, La Forge shouts after him, ""This oughta be a lot of fun!"" Walking further up the corridor, Data sees three workmen destroying a warp plasma conduit. He first asks if they have authorization to work here, then tells them he must ask them to stop, and after he speaks, he emits a high-pitched sound through his mouth. The workers tell him to be quiet, then attack and dismantle him, first his left arm, then his right leg, and then ultimately his head. A startled Data suddenly wakes up in his bed. "	Data deals with his new ability to experience nightmares as the Enterprise deals with the installation of a new warp core that won't work as expected.

However, she suffers a breakdown and Troi must enter her mother's mind to save her life.	Lwaxana Troi returns to the USS Enterprise-D, this time as the teacher of an alien race learning to speak, the Cairn. Their native form of communication is solely telepathy, but they want to learn spoken language in order to interact with other races and eventually to join with the United Federation of Planets. Lwaxana comes aboard with Maques and his daughter Hedril. Hedril is a young child and is Lwaxana's star pupil.  The crew begins to notice that Lwaxana doesn't seem to be her normal flamboyant self. She's quiet and almost reserved, even her clothing seems subdued compared to usual. She perks up when talking to Worf and Commander Riker, explaining the telepaths can't read their minds, only other telepaths'. Deanna then walks in, and she quickly has her meet Maques and leaves with Hedril. After introductions, he says Lwaxana told him Deanna needs a husband, and he, coincidentally, needs a wife. 	While establishing diplomatic relations with an alien race called the Cairn, Deanna's mother experiences a mental breakdown and falls into a coma, and it seems like Deanna is the only one who is able to help her, even if her mother doesn't want it.

The Kes have applied to enter the Federation but the Prit are xenophobic. Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard beam down to open discussion with the Kes but are kidnapped by the Prit and find themselves able to read each other's minds by means of a surgical implant.	Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard are sharing breakfast in the captain's quarters. While Crusher tells Picard of the burgeoning romance between Nurse Alyssa Ogawa and Ensign Markson, Picard seems preoccupied. When confronted with his inattention, Picard confesses that he is, while not exactly worried, bothered by the idea of admitting only half of Kesprytt III to the Federation while leaving the other half out. Crusher attempts to alleviate his concerns by pointing out that the Kes inhabit about three-quarters of the planet and present all the characteristics necessary for admission, even if the Prytt are xenophobic and wish only to be left alone. If Australia had refused to join the United Earth Government in 2150, Crusher hypothetically asks Picard, should the people of Earth have been left out of the Federation? Picard is arguing that the cases are hardly analogous when he is interrupted by a communication from Commander Riker, alerting him to the fact that Ambassador Mauric is awaiting them on the planet. Picard and Crusher leave for the transporter room, but not before Crusher promises a special Vulcan dish for the next morning's breakfast. Lieutenant Worf is standing ready at the transporter console and beams Picard and Crusher to Mauric's chambers, after receiving confirmation from Kes Security Relay Station One that they have dropped their defense shield and are ready to receive transport. Worf is about to leave the transporter room after successfully beaming down the two officers when he receives word from Security Relay Station 1 that Picard and Crusher never arrived. He is stunned. 	Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher discover things about one another when they are captured by an opposing alien race, due to the fact that the Enterprise has come to allow the planet's other civilization the choice of being part of the Federation.

"Lieutenant Commander Data arrives at Geordi La Forge's quarters to take back Spot after La Forge borrowed her temporarily to experience having a pet cat before getting one for himself — a wise precaution, as La Forge found that he was nowhere near ready for a cat as yet. Spot had completely ruined his quarters and furniture during her stay. They discuss training Spot in order to rid her of her somewhat reckless behavior, but the discussion is interrupted when Commander Riker (on the intercom) calls all senior staff to the observation lounge for a mission briefing in ten minutes. Before leaving, they try to make an attempt to get her out from under La Forge's bed, only to have Spot destroy more items in La Forge's quarters. ""Training, definitely"", he tells Data.

When the Atreans discover that the core of their homeworld, Atrea IV, is cooling, posing a significant threat to the continued habitability of the planet, the USS Enterprise-D is dispatched to find a solution. Dr. Pran Tainer, an Atrean geologist, and his wife, Dr. Juliana Tainer, come on board to assist the Enterprise crew in this task. After briefing the senior officers on the nature of the problem and revealing that the planet will become uninhabitable in 13 months, Geordi La Forge and Data suggest employing ferro-plasmic infusion to reliquify the planet's core, using the Enterprise's phasers to drill through the surface and setting up plasma infusion units. Data believes that if the procedure is successful, the core will remain molten for centuries. After Captain Picard and Pran approve this plan, they, along with most of the other officers leave the observation lounge, leaving Data alone with Juliana Tainer. Juliana asks Data if he remembers her. When he says he does not, she reveals she was Dr. Noonien Soong's wife, and involved in Data's construction, therefore making her essentially Data's mother. 	"On Federation planet Atrea IV, Data encounters the former wife of his creator Noonian Soong who claims to be his ""mother""."

"Worf dictates a log entry while on a Type 6 shuttlecraft, the Curie. He picks up a Klingon trophy. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Worf walk down a corridor. Worf carries his bat'leth and trophy as Riker tells him that they are returning to the Argus Array. The subspace telescope has stopped transmitting data for the third time that year. He wants Worf to start a long range scan when he notices Worf's attention wandering and remarks that the Klingon seems extremely tense, considering the fact that he has just returned from a vacation. Worf replies that today is his birthday.  They reach Worf's quarters, but Worf is hesitant to enter. He cautiously looks around and Riker worriedly asks what's wrong. Worf is afraid that someone might have set up a surprise party for him. Riker says that he hates surprise parties and would never do something like that to him. Worf apologizes and Riker exits. Worf proudly studies his trophy, places it on a table and heads to the bedroom. Out of the darkness, happy shouts of ""Surprise!"" erupt. Lights come up and several crew members are revealed. As Deanna Troi and Beverly Crusher rush to kiss Worf, Riker comes in, puts a silly party hat on Worf's head and announces, ""I love surprise parties!"" "	On his return from a bat'leth competition in the Klingon Empire, Worf finds himself shifting realities where events and details are in a constant state of flux and only he is aware of the changes.

The Pegasus was the ship commanded by Adm. Pressman on which the crew mutineed shortly before Pressman, aided by a young Ensign Riker and some others, escaped. Their mission now is to find the ship, and the secret it carries, before the Romulans find it or the secret that Adm. Pressman has hidden onboard.	"In the observation lounge aboard the USS Enterprise-D, a brightly-colored banner hanging by the room's viewports proclaims it to be ""Captain Picard Day"". Picard, somewhat unhappy with the idea, surveys the numerous entries made for the event by the crew's children with Deanna Troi, as Commander Riker looks on, amused. Riker playfully uses one of the dolls and imitates Picard's voice, much to the captain's annoyance. A priority one message from Vice Admiral Blackwell is received, forcing him to excuse himself from the judging momentarily. After the admiral inquires as to the Enterprise's current status – conducting surveys of the Mekoria Quasar – she orders Picard to immediately rendezvous with the USS Crazy Horse in sector 1607 and pick up an operative from Starfleet Intelligence. She tells Picard the operative will brief him on his orders when he arrives. She also adds that Picard is authorized to exceed warp speed limitations for the duration of the mission. Noticing the banner behind Picard, she also inquires about ""Captain Picard Day,"" which embarrasses Picard. Laughing nervously, he tells the admiral that he is a role model for the children aboard the Enterprise. She tells Picard that she is sure he is and ends the transmission. Later, Picard walks to the transporter room with Riker. Picard mentions that he has set up a ""Commander Riker Day"" for next month and Riker sarcastically says that he thinks it's great. Entering the transporter room, Picard orders that the individual be beamed aboard. The operative turns out to be Erik Pressman, a former commanding officer of Riker's, and now a rear admiral. Picard recalls that Pressman was the captain of the USS Pegasus, Riker's first assignment. Pressman states that the Pegasus is the reason for his arrival – at Riker's shocked visage, he reveals that the ship is still out there ""…and the Romulans have found her."" "	Riker finds out his former commander from the starship Pegasus has orders that entail more than what is revealed to Picard, who thinks the Enterprise is en route to recover the lost ship. And Riker is ordered to secrecy.

The USS Enterprise-D has arrived at the planet Boraal II. Data reports that it is experiencing atmospheric dissipation and will be rendered uninhabitable in less than 38 hours. Lieutenant Worf is especially concerned with this recent development as his foster brother, Nikolai Rozhenko, is assigned to the one-man observation post on the planet. Worf asks Captain Picard for his permission to beam down and see if his foster brother is all right. Picard, concerned that Worf's visit may conflict with the Prime Directive, agrees, but says that to try to minimize the risk of contact with the inhabitants, Worf will go alone and must be surgically altered to pass as a Boraalan. After his alteration into a Boraalan by Dr. Crusher, Worf beams down to a cave where energy is detected. Shortly after, Worf finds Rozhenko and many Boraalans inside the cave and discovers that Rozhenko has broken the Prime Directive by shielding the cave, to help the Boraalans survive. 	In an attempt to preserve a race of people on a planet being bombarded by storms that would kill them, Worf's foster brother violates the Prime Directive, leaving the Enterprise crew in a difficult position.

Doctor Beverly Crusher reads a eulogy before her late grandmother's coffin at the Caldos colony graveyard, with Counselor Deanna Troi and Captain Jean-Luc Picard at her side, describing her grandmother, Felisa Howard, as a healer, and one who offers more than just a healthy body; she will miss her advice, healing, and most of all, her inspiration that she has provided Crusher with through the years. Governor Maturin reads a modified version of the Anglican burial service as her coffin slowly descends beneath the ground. As the colonists circle the grave and the gravediggers begin to bury her, a camellia is thrown to the coffin. Crusher looks over and sees a mysterious man walking with the other colonists who stops and gives her one glance before leaving. 	Dr. Crusher meets the man in her dead grandmother's life when she tries to put her affairs in order, whom one of the local people warn her to stay away from by not lighting a candle that has been lit for generations.

And how the ensigns deal with their situation, no matter how tough their commanding officers' demands are.	"Counselor Troi and Commander Riker are sitting together at a table discussing crew evaluations in Ten Forward, trying to decide who would be the best to fill a supervisory position. Riker laments that this is a recurring theme as they did crew evaluations three months ago. He decides that everyone on the ship will get promoted and calls it a night, addressing Troi as ""commander"", which Troi acknowledges, addressing him as ""captain"" and ordering two coffees. Across the table, Ensign Sam Lavelle, who is watching them with his friends Ensigns Sito Jaxa, Taurik, and Nurse Alyssa Ogawa, complains that their careers are literally being decided across the room. Ogawa tells him not to worry, and Sito tells him to just enjoy themselves. Lavelle decides to think about promotion out loud, much to the annoyance of Taurik. Ogawa and Sito explain to the Vulcan ensign that it's a time-honored strategy that the Bajorans use. He then finally jokes that by being promoted to Lieutenant, he would have his own crew quarters, whereupon Taurik says that he can request a new room assignment if he is not happy with sharing quarters with him, on the off chance he isn't promoted. This draws laughter from the table. The conversation between Troi and Riker changes to the Ops night duty officer. While Lavelle is an obvious choice, he's considering Sito as well. Ben, a waiter, serves the coffees to Riker and Troi, at the same time teasing Troi about dessert, whereupon Troi assures him that she doesn't want dessert and that he should not tempt her. Ben walks over to the junior officers and after much badgering, he tells them that apparently, Lavelle and Sito are up for the same position. "	A mission of the Enterprise is seen through the eyes of some junior officers who are up for promotions, as questions of duty and honor arise among some of them, such as a Bajoran whom Worf has designated to be promoted to operations.

Although he was not supposed to encounter any of the natives (and thereby not violate the Prime Directive) he wanders into the nearest village suffering from amnesia. Meanwhile, Deanna Troi decides she wants to take the necessary tests to achieve promotion to command level.	Beverly Crusher is in charge of the night shift on the USS Enterprise-D. Counselor Deanna Troi arrives on the ship after having attended a class reunion at Starbase 231. A conversation ensues between Crusher and Troi on the bridge in which the main subject is Crusher's past decision to apply for the rank of commander, a rank which she does not need as a requirement for the post of chief medical officer. Lieutenant Commander Data is commonly in charge of the night shift, but he is out on an away mission. A deep space probe containing radioactive material in its casing has crashed on a planet, Barkon IV, hosting a preindustrial civilization. Due to Data's android nature, he is the one best suited for the mission. He is hailed by the Enterprise's bridge by Ensign Rainer, but no response is received by them. Dr. Crusher is not overly concerned, as the radioactive nature of the fragments Data is supposed to collect on the planet are expected to disturb any received and sent messages, as Geordi La Forge had warned. Crusher thought she should probably try to hail him anyway. Crusher says that Data can wait for a few days before being picked up by the Enterprise as the ship has to rendezvous with the USS Lexington to deliver medical supplies to the Taranko colony.  In a village on Barkon IV, two Barkonians, a middle-aged man named Garvin and his young daughter, Gia, are talking. They are interrupted when Data walks in, his appearance suggesting that he has been through some rough experiences; his hair is tousled and his uniform is dirty and ripped in places. He stops when he sees them, but is only able to emit non-vocal sounds. 	Data is sent to follow a probe that has drifted off course and crashed on a primitive planet, only to crash on the planet himself, with no memory of any event prior to crashing on the planet's surface.

While probing the comet, the Enterprise is assaulted by a sensor echo and the ship begins slowly transforming into an alien city. Meanwhile Data becomes inflicted with multiple personalities - apparently entities from the ancient civilization.	Counselor Deanna Troi is attending Mrs. Narsu's class in Classroom 7 and helping the students convey their feelings in their clay sculptures. Data is also attending this class to work on using his imagination, and creates a nearly exact sculpture of a PADD (the dimensions accurate to within 1.3%). Troi tells him that he needs to work on his imagination, and as an exercise, suggests he sculpt music. Data is at first confused and points out that music is a collection of acoustic vibrations, but Troi encourages him to sculpt an image that reminds him of music. Data proceeds to form the clay into a treble clef, and Troi says they'll work on it further. First Officer Commander Riker contacts him and tells him to report to the bridge. The USS Enterprise-D is traveling through sector 1156 when they encounter a rogue comet which is not located on any of the Federation starcharts. It appears to have originated from the D'Arsay system, over two sectors away, and it seems to have been traveling for more than 87 million years. Captain Picard orders Data to begin a full sensor analysis and to send along his findings to the Federation Astrophysical survey. While scanning the comet, the bridge is illuminated with a strange, bright, ambient light which gradually fades away. Data says it appeared to be a sensor echo caused by a distortion in the comet's inner core. After compensating for the effect, Data announces that the sensor scan of the comet will be complete in 39 hours. In Troi's quarters, Beverly Crusher sees a strange object. When she asks what it is, Troi tells her she's never seen this object before, and its style makes it unlikely to be a gift from Riker. When Crusher and Troi leave the room to attend Lieutenant Worf's mok'bara class, a strange symbol appears on the object. 	Investigating a rogue comet that's been traveling throughout the universe for over 87 million years, Picard discovers alien beings within the comet, which infest the computer systems on the Enterprise, as well as Data.

Kwan's suicide on board the Enterprise sparks some interesting results when Troi and Worf begin to investigate.	"The red alert klaxon wails on the bridge of the Enterprise as Lt. Commander Data reports that they're losing containment in the starboard nacelle tube. Captain Picard orders more power to the field coils, and asks Lt. Commander La Forge for a report, which the chief engineer replies that someone has locked out the plasma injector controls and they cannot be shut down. The venting system engages as the Enterprise begins to vent plasma from the nacelle. Commander Riker and Lieutenant Worf race to the control room of the nacelle tube via a ladder in the Jefferies tube while Picard takes precautionary measures and orders the exterior hull plate released so they may jettison the warp core. When both Riker and Worf arrive, they find Lieutenant Daniel Kwan on the catwalk staring at the plasma stream. Lieutenant Nara is at her station, unable to shut down the plasma flow. She warns both officers that if they approach Kwan, she fears he'll jump through the force field and into the stream. Worf goes to try to circumvent the override Kwan placed on the injectors while Riker slowly moves towards him and tries to talk him down from the catwalk. Kwan oddly remarks about people laughing at him, and that he does not want to do what he is about to. Riker assures him that they'll talk about it but Kwan warns him to stay away. Worf gets control back, but there is still active plasma in the tube and it will take time to dissipate. Nearly desperate to buy the time, Riker tries to distract Kwan by getting him to explain his problem, but he calmly replies by saying, ""I know what I have to do."" Kwan then jumps into the plasma stream and kills himself, shocking Worf and Nara, with Riker slamming his hand against the bulkhead, visibly upset. "	As a young lieutenant aboard the Enterprise commits suicide, his shipmates deal with the loss and Deanna deals with feelings surrounding her as she and Worf begin to form a relationship.

Barclay.	In sickbay, Nurse Alyssa Ogawa removes spines from Commander Riker's back; an accident while he was in the arboretum with Rebecca Smith had resulted in a close encounter with a Cypirion cactus. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Barclay, having diagnosed himself with a lethal illness, goes to see Doctor Crusher – who assures him that he in fact is not suffering from any lethal illness at all, but instead has a mild case of Urodelan flu. Humans typically exhibit a natural immunity to the flu, but since the T-cells that would normally fight off the infection are dormant, she activates that particular gene with a synthetic T-cell to let his body fight the infection naturally. Data soon arrives carrying his cat, Spot. The cat is here for a routine check on the progress of her pregnancy; she is expected to deliver before the end of the week. The talk of babies prompts Ogawa to reveal that she is herself pregnant with her husband's child, prompting congratulations from Crusher. 	When a new torpedo guidance system malfunctions, Picard and Data go chasing after it into an asteroid field, while the crew is left behind to deal with their own strange behaviors.

Wesley tells his mother than she knows that is not why he asked for separate quarters this time. Then, the door chime rings and Geordi La Forge and Data show up to welcome Wesley, happy to see him. However, Wesley is not his usual jovial self. La Forge and Data both make a joke asking if there is a runaway cadet in the quarters and Data notices that Wesley is clearly not a joking mood. His mother is aware of this and says they should let him settle in. When they leave, Wesley sullenly glances around his quarters and sits down on his bed.

He tells Alexander that there are actually two Rite of Ascension ceremonies; Alexander won't be required to pass through the second rite (the one with painstiks) until he is older, but is old enough for the first rite now. His fighting skills and his knowledge of the teachings of Kahless will be tested, and Worf promises to help him with this. The first step is lighting a kor'tova candle and declaring one's intention to be a Klingon warrior.  Alexander doesn't want to do it, reminding Worf that his mother K'Ehleyr told him he didn't have to do any ""Klingon stuff"" he didn't want to.
