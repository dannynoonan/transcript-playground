We were on a ship together. The Enterprise.  GUINAN: Is that a clipper ship?  DATA: It is a starship.  CLEMENS: Starship?  RIKER: My God. They're delivering more of them for the others to ingest.  GUINAN: Did my father send you here? Because if he did, you must go back and tell him I'm not done listening to  DATA: I was not sent by your father. Our ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening nineteenth century Earth.  RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and just leave it at that.

In fact, I have learned that, even now, there are people from the future right here in San Francisco and I have no doubt that their intent is to foul our world just as my Yankee did in King Arthur's time.
