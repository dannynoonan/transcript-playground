We've found the Captain's uniform and his communicator. CRUSHER: Jean-Luc! DATA: We were unable to retrieve him, sir. Sir, The Captain has been altered by the Borg. CRUSHER: Will, he's alive. If we could get him back to the ship, I might be able to restore RIKER: This is our only chance to destroy them. If they get back into warp, our weapon is useless. PICARD : I am Locutus of Borg.
